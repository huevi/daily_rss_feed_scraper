Most male anchors (50.33%) were also found to demean or undermine guests and sources, whereas less than a third of female anchors (30.34%) resorted to this, the study said. Aggression was observed in more than 50% of all news shows that were sampled, and it increased to 85% for talk shows. The study was conducted in association with Network of Women in Media, India (NWMI).\nThe study was conducted by monitoring 185 news and talk shows across 31 television channels in 12 languages between September 19, 2021 and September 25, 2021. Titled \u201cAggressive Masculinity in Journalistic Performance and Social Media Discourse\u201d, the study focused on three aspects: aggression/anger, dominance and sexism. Tone of voice was the most common expression of aggression (76.8%), while elements that increased stridency such as sound and visual effects occurred frequently (60%). Panels moderated by male anchors revealed relatively more aggressive masculinist behavior (54.55%) on several metrics than those moderated by female anchors (12.07%).\nAggression was mostly found in \u200b\u200bEnglish media at 24.72%, followed by Gujarati media at 15.93%, which was the third most monitored language in the research. For the variable of \u2018dominance\u2019, Hindi media (making up 10% of the samples) took the lead with 34.86%. Bengali media appeared to have fewer elements of dominance. While Tamil media made up only 5% (from two channels: Polimer News and News18 Tamil) of the total samples examined in the study, it had the maximum share of \u2018highly present\u2019 for the variable of \u2018sexism\u2019 at 38.70%.\nThe volunteers used a scale of impressions of aggression as highly present, somewhat present, minimally present, and absent, expressed through seven aspects: body language, words, tone of voice, use of visuals and graphic elements, sound effects, and interpersonal dynamics.&nbsp; Combining the scores for \u2018highly present\u2019, \u2018somewhat present\u2019, and \u2018minimally present\u2019, the study found that aggressive behaviours occurred 63% to 76% of the time across the 185 episodes analysed.&nbsp;\n\n\tAggression against minority communities\nThe volunteers from NWMI also noted the presence of aggressively worded hashtags such as #StopHinduphobia, terms such as \u201cgaddar\u201d (traitor) for people from minority communities or political opponents, and/or descriptions such as \u201cbehaved like a man\u201d to connote approval of a news subject.&nbsp;\nOverall, women anchors in the sample displayed signs of aggression and anger less often than the male anchors. However, this difference varied across indicators.&nbsp;\nAggressive interpersonal dynamics (understood in the form of interruptions, derision, etc.) had the widest gender gap \u2014 female anchors displayed such behaviours 31.46% of the time, compared to 56.25% for male anchors. A substantial difference was also found in aggressive word usage (58.43% by women and 71.88% by men). Notably, both women (75.28%) and men (78.13%) were found to employ an aggressive tone of voice in a comparably high proportion of instances, the study said.\n\n\tDomineering over guests\nWhen it came to dominating the news show, both male and female anchors were found to use a domineering tone of voice in their delivery in a large number of instances (male: 81.25%, female: 74.16%). The biggest recorded disparity between men and women\u2019s performances of dominance was with respect to interpersonal dynamics: male anchors were found to demean or otherwise undermine their guests/sources in 58.33% of the observed instances, whereas the same behaviour was observed in female anchors 30.34% of the time. Dominance was also measured using the categories of \u2018highly present\u2019, \u2018somewhat present\u2019 and \u2018minimally present\u2019 which were combined into a single category.&nbsp;\nDominance was recorded by observing&nbsp; the journalist\u2019s confrontation over dialogue (frequent interruptions, for example), competition rather than collaboration/cooperation, denial of agency to women/queer persons, exhibition of control/ownership over female/queer bodies, assertion as custodians of a certain \u201cculture\u201d, interpersonal dynamics that disparage/diminish invited guests/sources, evidence of identity-based prejudices leading to discrimination based on caste, tribe, religion and/or other identities.\nInterestingly, women journalists displayed relatively more dominance (17%) when it came to discussing the issue of caste-based violence, compared to men journalists (16%).&nbsp;\n\n\tSexism propagated by both men and women anchors\nThere was no notable difference between male and female hosts/anchors with respect to sexist behaviours. However, the use of dismissive language towards women or other genders was found to be slightly higher in the case of male anchors than women anchors (27.66% and 19.54% respectively), the study found.\nSexism was measured by observing the&nbsp; patronising, dismissive or aggressive behaviour towards women and femininity, presence of obvious misogyny and queerphobia, objectification/commodification of women, distrust/hatred/ignorance of nonheteronormative persons.&nbsp;\nThe following channels were monitored for the study: \u200b\u200bABP Ananda (Bangla), ABP Asmita (Gujarati), ABP Majha (Marathi), ABP News (Hindi), Asianet (Kannada), Asianet (Malayalam) CNN-News 18 (English), DD India (English), DD Malayalam (Malayalam), DY365 (Assamese), Kanak TV (Odia), Mathrubhumi (Malayalam), ND 24x7 (Assamese), NDTV Hindi (Hindi), News 18 Bangla (Bangla), News 18 Gujarati (Gujarati), News 18 (Tamil), Odisha TV (Odia), Pratidin Time (Assamese), Public TV (Kannada), PTC (Punjabi), Polimer News (Tamil), Republic (English), Saam TV (Marathi), Times Now (English), TV 9 (Gujarati), TV 9 (Bangla), V6 News (Telugu), WION (English), Zee 24 Ghanta (Bangla), and Zee Hindustan (Hindi).\n\n\t&nbsp;\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Media study</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The study was conducted by monitoring 185 news and talk shows across 31 television channels in 12 languages between September 19, 2021 and September 25, 2021.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/tnm-staff\"">TNM Staff</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Indian_Male_anchors_Arnab_Rahul.jpg\""><img alt=\""Collage of news anchors Rahul Shivshankar and Arnab Goswami\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Indian_Male_anchors_Arnab_Rahul.jpg?itok=x14XrwQU\"" title=\""Collage of news anchors Rahul Shivshankar and Arnab Goswami\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Panels moderated by male anchors in news shows exhibited more aggressive and masculinist behavior than those moderated by women, revealed a study conducted by the Department of Communication, University of Hyderabad.

However, the use of dismissive language towards women or other genders was found to be slightly higher in the case of male anchors than women anchors (27.66% and 19.54% respectively), the study found.\nSexism was measured by observing the&nbsp; patronising, dismissive or aggressive behaviour towards women and femininity, presence of obvious misogyny and queerphobia, objectification/commodification of women, distrust/hatred/ignorance of nonheteronormative persons.&nbsp;\nThe following channels were monitored for the study: \u200b\u200bABP Ananda (Bangla), ABP Asmita (Gujarati), ABP Majha (Marathi), ABP News (Hindi), Asianet (Kannada), Asianet (Malayalam) CNN-News 18 (English), DD India (English), DD Malayalam (Malayalam), DY365 (Assamese), Kanak TV (Odia), Mathrubhumi (Malayalam), ND 24x7 (Assamese), NDTV Hindi (Hindi), News 18 Bangla (Bangla), News 18 Gujarati (Gujarati), News 18 (Tamil), Odisha TV (Odia), Pratidin Time (Assamese), Public TV (Kannada), PTC (Punjabi), Polimer News (Tamil), Republic (English), Saam TV (Marathi), Times Now (English), TV 9 (Gujarati), TV 9 (Bangla), V6 News (Telugu), WION (English), Zee 24 Ghanta (Bangla), and Zee Hindustan (Hindi).\n\n\t&nbsp;\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 12:10:43 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 12, 12, 10, 43, 5, 43, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Balakrishna""}], ""author"": ""Balakrishna"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Balakrishna""}, ""id"": ""160906 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/aggressive-masculinity-rampant-tv-news-male-anchors-demean-guests-more-study-160906#comments""}, {""title"": ""Rahul Bajaj, former chairman of Bajaj Group, passes away at 83"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news-feeds"", ""value"": ""Rahul Bajaj, former chairman of Bajaj Group, passes away at 83""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/rahul-bajaj-former-chairman-bajaj-group-passes-away-83-160905""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/rahul-bajaj-former-chairman-bajaj-group-passes-away-83-160905"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Death</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Bajaj was not keeping well for quite some time and passed away at around 14.30 hours on Saturday, a company official said.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/agencies\"">Agencies</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Rahul%20Bajaj_RichterFrankJurgen_flickr_0.jpg\""><img alt=\""Rahul Bajaj\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Rahul%20Bajaj_RichterFrankJurgen_flickr_0.jpg?itok=ZaMfhpE4\"" title=\""Rahul Bajaj\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Former chairman of the Bajaj Group Rahul Bajaj passed away in Pune on Saturday, February 12, a company official said.

As the House met for the day, Opposition members from various parties rose from their seats and reached near the well protesting against Adityanath's remarks.\nMPs from Kerala Congress had moved an adjournment motion over the remarks. Speaker Om Birla said the matter would be taken up after the Question Hour ends and asked the protesting members to go back to their respective seats. Soon after, the members from TMC, Congress, Kerala Congress, National Conference, DMK and SP walked out of the House.\nDuring the protest, TMC MP Saugata Roy called Adityanath \""Jogi\"", while BSP leader Kunwar Danish Ali said, \""I seek apology from all of you that my Chief Minister is Ajay Bisht.\"" Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said such remarks made by a Chief Minister are highly condemnable. This is the first time during the ongoing session of Parliament, which began on January 31, that Lok Sabha witnessed protests during Question Hour.\nIn a video message on Twitter, Adityanath had on Thursday, February 10, said, \""Beware!

The probe is linked to alleged irregularities in charitable funds raised from public donors, agency sources told PTI on Thursday, February 10. The federal investigation agency had issued a provisional order under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to attach a Rs 50 lakh worth fixed deposit, and the remaining amount kept as bank deposits and held in two accounts of a private bank in Navi Mumbai.\nAyyub is the account holder and deposits totalling Rs 1,77,27,704 have been attached by the ED. The money laundering case against her was filed after taking cognisance of a September 2021 FIR of the Ghaziabad Police in Uttar Pradesh related to alleged irregularities in donor funds of over Rs 2.69 crore raised by her through online crowdfunding platform called Ketto.\nThe police lodged the case on a complaint made by Vikas Sankrityayan, founder of an NGO called \u2018Hindu IT Cell\u2019 and a resident of Indirapuram in Ghaziabad. Ayyub had then stated that the \""entire donation received through Ketto is accounted for and not a single paisa has been misused\"".\nAccording to the FIR, the funds were raised as part of three campaigns; funds for slum dwellers and farmers during April-May 2020, relief work in Assam, Bihar and Maharashtra during June-September 2020, and help for COVID-19 impacted people in India during May-June 2021.\n\""Funds totalling Rs 2,69,44,680 were raised on Ketto by Rana Ayyub.

Out of this amount, Rs 72,01,786 was withdrawn in her own bank account, Rs 37,15,072 withdrawn in her sister Iffat Shaikh's account, and Rs 1,60,27,822 was withdrawn in her father Mohd Ayyub Waquif's bank account, the ED said.\nAll these funds, the ED claimed, were subsequently transferred into Ayyub's own account. Ayyub submitted documents of expense for Rs 31,16,770 to the ED. However, after verification of the claimed expenses, the agency said that it found that the actual expenses were to the tune of Rs 17,66,970.\n\""Fake bills were found to have been prepared by Rana Ayyub in the name of some entities to claim expenses on relief work. Expenses made for personal travel by air were claimed as expenses for relief work,\"" it alleged. The ED said its probe \""makes it abundantly clear that the funds were raised in the name of charity in a completely pre-planned and systematic manner, and the funds were not utilised completely for the purpose of which the funds were raised\"".\n\""Instead of utilising the funds for the relief work, Rana Ayyub parked some of the funds by opening a separate current bank account,\"" it said. Ayyub, it added, created the fixed deposit of Rs 50 lakh from the funds raised on the online platform and subsequently \""did not utilise\"" these for relief work.

Additionally, he was also accused of not disclosing his assets and also secretly trying to dispose of the assets to defeat the purpose of recovery proceedings.\nOn October 6, 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has told the Supreme Court that the UK Home Office has intimated that there is a further legal issue which needs to be resolved before Mallya's extradition takes place and this issue is outside and apart from the extradition process having effect under the UK law.\nThe affidavit had said that Mallya's surrender to India should, in principle, have been completed within 28 days after he lost the appeal against extradition. However, the UK Home Office then intimated India of the further legal issue.\nOn November 2 last year, the top court had asked the Union government to file a status report on extradition of the fugitive businessman within six weeks, and on November 30, it said it will begin hearing on sentencing of him in contempt of court, in which he was held guilty in July 2017.\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Court</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">A Supreme Court bench said Mallya was found guilty of contempt and punishment has to be imposed and by normal logic, the contemnor has to be heard, but has not appeared before the court so far. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/ians\"">IANS</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Vijay_Mallya_PTI_FinancialTimes_1200x800_29042016.jpg\""><img alt=\""Vijay Mallya: SC gives Vijay Mallya last chance to show up for contempt case hearing \"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Vijay_Mallya_PTI_FinancialTimes_1200x800_29042016.jpg?itok=BPMGmw0J\"" title=\""Vijay Mallya: SC gives Vijay Mallya last chance to show up for contempt case hearing \"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">File Photo: PTI Photo / Financial Times </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The Supreme Court on Thursday, February 10, gave a final opportunity to fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya to appear before it, before it pronounces its sentence in a contempt case filed by banks, in which he was found guilty.

If testing positive, their contacts shall be identified and managed as per laid down protocol, according to the revised guidelines.\nEarlier, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had informed the Rajya Sabha that Omicron variant is the dominant variant in the country presently, and the current surge of COVID-19 cases in the country is showing a sustained declining trend since January 21.&nbsp;\nFollowing a risk based approach, provisions for mandatory pre-departure and post arrival RT-PCR testing on 8th day of arrival and a mandatory home quarantine for 7 days have been made in the guidelines for all international travellers to India, he had said.&nbsp;\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Thu, 10 Feb 2022 08:49:03 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 10, 8, 49, 3, 3, 41, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""LukeKoshi""}], ""author"": ""LukeKoshi"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""LukeKoshi""}, ""id"": ""160829 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/no-home-quarantine-international-travellers-risk-nations-category-removed-160829#comments""}], ""feed"": {""language"": ""en"", ""title"": ""News Feeds(India and world)"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news-feeds"", ""value"": ""News Feeds(India and world)""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news-feeds""}, {""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news.xml"", ""rel"": ""self"", ""type"": ""application/rss+xml""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news-feeds"", ""subtitle"": """", ""subtitle_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news-feeds"", ""value"": """"}}, ""headers"": {""server"": ""nginx"", ""date"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:24:55 GMT"", ""content-type"": ""application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8"", ""transfer-encoding"": ""chunked"", ""connection"": ""close"", ""x-drupal-cache"": ""MISS"", ""vary"": ""Cookie"", ""cache-control"": ""no-cache, must-revalidate"", ""x-content-type-options"": ""nosniff"", ""expires"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:29:55"", ""content-language"": ""en"", ""x-frame-options"": ""ALLOW FROM SAMEORIGIN, SAMEDOMAIN, https://jionewsdev1.jio.ril.com/, https://jionews.com/"", ""permissions-policy"": ""interest-cohort=()"", ""x-cache-status"": ""MISS""}, ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/news.xml"", ""status"": 200, ""encoding"": ""utf-8"", ""version"": ""rss20"", ""namespaces"": {""dc"": ""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"", """": ""http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"", ""og"": ""http://ogp.me/ns#"", ""content"": ""http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"", ""foaf"": ""http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"", ""rdfs"": ""http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"", ""sioc"": ""http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"", ""sioct"": ""http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#"", ""skos"": ""http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"", ""xsd"": ""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#""}}"

Now they will have to redo the official figures after this exercise.\u201d\nIt is likely that all states will have to rework the official state death toll and republish the figures once this exercise is over.\n\n&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;\nHow Nalgonda cops cracked down on a 460 kg ganja haul with TRS link\nSix people killed in three separate accidents in Andhra's Kurnool district\nA tiny Telangana village, and Dalit residents\u2019 fight to shut down illegal liquor shops\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Fri, 11 Feb 2022 12:58:54 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 11, 12, 58, 54, 4, 42, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Paul Oommen""}], ""author"": ""Paul Oommen"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Paul Oommen""}, ""id"": ""160881 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/andhra-covid-19-ex-gratia-claims-are-nearly-three-times-official-death-toll-160881#comments""}, {""title"": ""Six people killed in three separate accidents in Andhra's Kurnool district"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/andhra-feeds"", ""value"": ""Six people killed in three separate accidents in Andhra's Kurnool district""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/six-people-killed-three-separate-accidents-andhras-kurnool-district-160874""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/six-people-killed-three-separate-accidents-andhras-kurnool-district-160874"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Accident</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">In one incident, three members of a family were killed when their car rammed into a parked truck at Ulindakonda on a national highway towards Bengaluru. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/ians\"">IANS</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Kurnool_accident_1200x800_11022022.jpg\""><img alt=\""Car mangled in an accident in Kurnool: Six people killed in three separate accidents in Andhra&#039;s Kurnool district\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Kurnool_accident_1200x800_11022022.jpg?itok=NChP-Y1r\"" title=\""Car mangled in an accident in Kurnool: Six people killed in three separate accidents in Andhra&#039;s Kurnool district\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Six people were killed in three separate road accidents in Andhra Pradesh's Kurnool district on Friday, February 11, police said.

The Association has also sought a public apology from the Minister for using abusive language and behaving rudely with the officer. The Minister was caught on camera abusing and threatening a police inspector during the annual festival of Sri Sarada Peetham in Visakhapatnam attended by the Chief Minister.\nAppalaraju was reportedly miffed after the police officer stopped the entry of his supporters inside Sarada Peetham. The video of the Minister abusing the police official and threatening him went viral on social media. The Andhra Pradesh Police Officers' Association president J Srinivasa Rao and others condemned the incident and demanded that the Appalaraju tender a public apology.\nThey said it was unfortunate that a responsible Minister used abusive words and acted rudely with an officer of a key department of the government discharging his duties. The Association urged the Chief Minister to order an inquiry and take appropriate action against Appalaraju and ensure that such incidents are not repeated in future.\nEarlier, opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) general secretary Nara Lokesh posted the video of the incident on Twitter and asked if the Association will show some courage to speak out on the incident.

The Association has also sought a public apology from the Minister for using abusive language and behaving rudely with the officer. The Minister was caught on camera abusing and threatening a police inspector during the annual festival of Sri Sarada Peetham in Visakhapatnam attended by the Chief Minister.\nAppalaraju was reportedly miffed after the police officer stopped the entry of his supporters inside Sarada Peetham. The video of the Minister abusing the police official and threatening him went viral on social media. The Andhra Pradesh Police Officers' Association president J Srinivasa Rao and others condemned the incident and demanded that the Appalaraju tender a public apology.\nThey said it was unfortunate that a responsible Minister used abusive words and acted rudely with an officer of a key department of the government discharging his duties. The Association urged the Chief Minister to order an inquiry and take appropriate action against Appalaraju and ensure that such incidents are not repeated in future.\nEarlier, opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) general secretary Nara Lokesh posted the video of the incident on Twitter and asked if the Association will show some courage to speak out on the incident. The TDP leader wrote that the DGP and Association faulted his party leaders whenever they raised the issue of law and order and crimes against women. \""Let us see if the Association or police boss reacts to this or blames the person who video recorded it,\"" he had tweeted.\n\n\t\u0c2a\u0c4b\u0c32\u0c40\u0c38\u0c41 \u0c05\u0c27\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41\u0c32 \u0c38\u0c02\u0c18\u0c02, \u0c2a\u0c4b\u0c32\u0c40\u0c38\u0c41\u0c2c\u0c3e\u0c38\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41 \u0c26\u0c40\u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c48 \u0c38\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4b! \u0c32\u0c47\u0c26\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c2e\u0c02\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c1f\u200c\u0c21\u0c02 \u0c24\u200c\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c41\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c26\u0c41.. \u0c06 \u0c24\u0c3f\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u200c\u0c28\u0c41 \u0c30\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c1a\u0c47\u0c38\u0c3f\u0c28 \u0c35\u0c4d\u0c2f\u200c\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c3f\u0c26\u0c3f \u0c28\u0c47\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c05\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c42 \u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u200c\u0c15\u200c\u0c1f\u0c3f\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4b? \u0c1a\u0c42\u0c26\u0c4d\u0c26\u0c3e\u0c02.(3/3)@APPOLICE100\n\t\u2014 Lokesh Nara (@naralokesh) February 9, 2022\n\nThe Minister's action has evoked condemnation from the BJP as well.

State Animal Husbandry Minister Sidiri Appala Raju was caught on video shoving a police inspector and threatening him in abusive language after the former's followers were prevented entry into the ashram which the Chief Minister visited.\nThe opposition parties demanded that the minister be removed from the Cabinet over his act. The road leading to the Visakhapatnam Airport was sealed off leaving passengers stranded kilometres away. Following this, passengers sat on a protest and wondered how they could be prevented from going to the airport to catch their flights. Also, shops and businesses on the Airport-Gopalapaltnam-Pendurthi road were shut for the Chief Minister's visit.\nInterestingly, a lone government liquor vend was found open and carrying on business as usual. A video clip of this too, went viral on social media. Visakhapatnam city Commissioner of Police Manish Sinha, however, told PTI that everything was done as per the security protocol. No businesses were closed. Airport road was blocked during the movement of the convoy as per the security protocol, Sinha said.\nOn the incident involving the minister, he said the minister was not stopped from entering.

Minister Appala Raju, along with his followers, reached the ashram but only he was allowed in. Taking exception to this, the minister was seen arguing with the police inspector posted there. Shoving the inspector away, and abusing him in derogatory language, Appala Raju demanded that the Commissioner of Police himself come to him and give an explanation, though an Assistant Commissioner of Police sought to pacify him.\nThere were two or three state officials with me. One of them was prevented entry. The gate was shut on my face. He did it deliberately, the minister told PTI. The inspector spoke in a rude manner to a minister. He should not have behaved like that, Appala Raju added. The minister, however, said he was not pressing for any action against the police official.\nBJP state general secretary S Vishnuvardhan Reddy condemned the Animal Husbandry Minister's behaviour and demanded that he be immediately removed from the Cabinet. Vishnu demanded that a case be registered against the Minister and he be arrested for his action against the police officials. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) too demanded that Appala Raju be sacked from the Council of Ministers. TDP senior leader Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy hit out at the State Director General of Police DG Sawang for remaining silent over the incident.\n\""How could the police create a curfew-like atmosphere and paralyse normal life for the Chief Minister's visit?

One of them was prevented entry. The gate was shut on my face. He did it deliberately, the minister told PTI. The inspector spoke in a rude manner to a minister. He should not have behaved like that, Appala Raju added. The minister, however, said he was not pressing for any action against the police official.\nBJP state general secretary S Vishnuvardhan Reddy condemned the Animal Husbandry Minister's behaviour and demanded that he be immediately removed from the Cabinet. Vishnu demanded that a case be registered against the Minister and he be arrested for his action against the police officials. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) too demanded that Appala Raju be sacked from the Council of Ministers. TDP senior leader Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy hit out at the State Director General of Police DG Sawang for remaining silent over the incident.\n\""How could the police create a curfew-like atmosphere and paralyse normal life for the Chief Minister's visit? The Chief Minister should tender an apology to the people for causing such inconvenience, the former minister demanded.\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Thu, 10 Feb 2022 03:18:22 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 10, 3, 18, 22, 3, 41, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""BNitin""}], ""author"": ""BNitin"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""BNitin""}, ""id"": ""160812 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/andhra-min-caught-cam-abusing-cops-during-cm-jagan-s-vizag-visit-160812#comments""}, {""title"": ""Andhra officials mull underpass for vehicles after leopard killed on highway"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/andhra-feeds"", ""value"": ""Andhra officials mull underpass for vehicles after leopard killed on highway""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/andhra-officials-mull-underpass-vehicles-after-leopard-killed-highway-160791""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/andhra-officials-mull-underpass-vehicles-after-leopard-killed-highway-160791"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Wildlife</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The cub, which was aged around one to two years, seemed to have been crossing the road to drink water when it was hit by a vehicle, forest officials said. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/tnm-staff\"">TNM Staff</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Dead_Leopard_AP_1200x800_09022022.jpg\""><img alt=\""Leopard killed in accident on highway in Andhra Pradesh \"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Dead_Leopard_AP_1200x800_09022022.jpg?itok=4Z4FcHR_\"" title=\""Leopard killed in accident on highway in Andhra Pradesh \"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">A leopard cub was killed in what appeared to be a hit-and-run accident on the Kadapa-Chittoor highway near Rayachoti in Andhra Pradesh. The incident happened around 3.30 am in the early hours of February 9, Tuesday, when the cub, which was aged around one to two years, was trying to cross the highway. Forest Department officials said that the cub was likely to have been crossing the road to drink water, as there is a pond on the opposite side of the road, near Guvvalacheruvu village.&nbsp;\nAccording to Rayachoti Forest Range Officer (FRO) Prasad, the cub appeared to have been unable to cross the metal divider on the highway as it was too high. \u201cThe divider was too tall so it was unable to cross it. Meanwhile, an unidentified vehicle came and hit the cub, killing it. Based on the marks on its body, it looks like it was a small vehicle. We are investigating the case and trying to identify the vehicle,\u201d FRO Prasad said.&nbsp;\nThe Forest Department will soon send a proposal to highway authorities to build an underpass as an alternative route for vehicles and to allow free movement of wildlife, as there is a danger of such accidents recurring in the future, Prasad said. He added that in the interim, some of the metal dividers could be removed to allow the animals to cross the highway easily.&nbsp;\n\u201cA post mortem is also being done to find out if it was poisoned or poached for specific body parts. We found that all body parts are intact. We also examined if there were any attempts of hunting or poaching nearby but we found no indications of traps or anything like that,\u201d Prasad said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAccording to Prasad, the leopard population has increased in the region in recent years due to minimal human interference. There is frequent animal movement on the Chittoor-Kadapa highway as animals often cross the road to drink water, he said, adding that tigers and leopards usually move actively at nighttime on the highway, which has forest areas on either side.

The employees' unions have been saying that implementation of the new PRC announced last month will lead to downward revision of salaries. They are demanding that the employees be paid salaries as per the previous pay scales, saying the interim relief was higher than the 23% pay revision announced by the Chief Minister.\nCiting the denial of permission for the protest program in view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, police detained leaders of various unions of government employees and teachers in various districts. Vijayawada Police Commissioner Kanti Rana Tata said there was no permission for 'Chalo Vijayawada'. He said the police received an application for permission but they denied the same as a huge congregation can't be allowed in view of the pandemic situation.\nMeanwhile, state level leaders of the unions made it clear that they will go ahead with 'Chalo Vijayawada' despite arrests, detentions and other measures by the government to foil their program. PRC Sadhana Samiti, the joint action committee of all employees' associations, has already announced that employees will go on strike from February 7 in support of their demands.\nThe unions have been staging protests for the last couple of weeks, demanding scrapping of a Government Order (GO) fixing new pay scales as per the pay revision announced last month. They have alleged that implementation of the new pay scale will result in downward revision in their salaries.&nbsp;\nThe leaders were either placed under house arrest or summoned to police stations to serve notices, directing them not to leave for Vijayawada for the protest. They were being told that if they go ahead with the protest, action will be taken against them as per law. In some places leaders and members of the unions were stopped from proceeding towards Vijayawada.\nReports of detentions came in from Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Nellore, Anantapur and other districts, according to IANS. Police have also set up check posts on the highway near Tuni in East Godavari district to check the vehicles to stop employees heading for Vijayawada.\nVijayawada Police Commissioner Kanti Rana Tata&nbsp; said such a congregation could lead to further spread of the pandemic, and would violate the guidelines issued by the state government, which prohibits any program with a gathering of more than 200.

The employees' unions have been saying that implementation of the new PRC announced last month will lead to downward revision of salaries. They are demanding that the employees be paid salaries as per the previous pay scales, saying the interim relief was higher than the 23% pay revision announced by the Chief Minister.\nCiting the denial of permission for the protest program in view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, police detained leaders of various unions of government employees and teachers in various districts. Vijayawada Police Commissioner Kanti Rana Tata said there was no permission for 'Chalo Vijayawada'. He said the police received an application for permission but they denied the same as a huge congregation can't be allowed in view of the pandemic situation.\nMeanwhile, state level leaders of the unions made it clear that they will go ahead with 'Chalo Vijayawada' despite arrests, detentions and other measures by the government to foil their program. PRC Sadhana Samiti, the joint action committee of all employees' associations, has already announced that employees will go on strike from February 7 in support of their demands.\nThe unions have been staging protests for the last couple of weeks, demanding scrapping of a Government Order (GO) fixing new pay scales as per the pay revision announced last month. They have alleged that implementation of the new pay scale will result in downward revision in their salaries.&nbsp;\nThe leaders were either placed under house arrest or summoned to police stations to serve notices, directing them not to leave for Vijayawada for the protest. They were being told that if they go ahead with the protest, action will be taken against them as per law. In some places leaders and members of the unions were stopped from proceeding towards Vijayawada.\nReports of detentions came in from Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, Nellore, Anantapur and other districts, according to IANS. Police have also set up check posts on the highway near Tuni in East Godavari district to check the vehicles to stop employees heading for Vijayawada.\nVijayawada Police Commissioner Kanti Rana Tata&nbsp; said such a congregation could lead to further spread of the pandemic, and would violate the guidelines issued by the state government, which prohibits any program with a gathering of more than 200. The commissioner said since over 5,000 employees are likely to participate in 'Chalo Vijayawada' permission was not given for the same.\nThe police official said the section 30 of the Police Act and section 144 of CrPC are in force in Vijayawada and gathering of more than five persons will be a violation of law.\nAs part of the protest programme chalked out by the unions, the employees plan to stop running and maintaining various government apps from Wednesday, February 3.

The tower, which is a Guntur city landmark, has been mired in controversy over being named in honour of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. Demands from BJP and various Hindu organisations to rename the tower have grown louder in recent weeks.&nbsp;\nObjecting to the use of Jinnah\u2019s name for a major city centre in Andhra Pradesh, the state unit of the BJP has been demanding that the tower be renamed in honour of former president APJ Abdul Kalam, or culturally important persons or freedom fighters from the Guntur district like Telugu poet Gurram Jashua. It was on the heels of this controversy that authorities from the ruling YSRCP along with the Guntur Municipal Corporation painted the tower in tricolours of the national flag.&nbsp;\n\n\tThe history of the tower&nbsp;\nJinnah Tower is a key landmark in Guntur city, located on Mahatma Gandhi Road, an arterial road of the city. Despite the conflicts between India and Pakistan, the tower has continued to stand in the city with the same name, remaining a symbol of harmony.&nbsp;\nThe tower, built in honour of Jinnah in the pre-Independence era, stands tall on six pillars and opens to a dome.

The party said they had expected a booster dose but the budget appeared like \u201call style but no substance.\u201d YSRCP Parliamentary Party leader V Vijayasai Reddy said the allocation of Rs 1 lakh crore for capital expenditure seems huge but when it comes to the state's share as per the set formula, Andhra Pradesh gets just 4.047% which works out to only Rs 4,000 crore.\nIn case of the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) as well, while the set norm is not more than 3% of the GSDP for states, there is no parity with respect to the Union government on the borrowings, he said. The state is still bearing the brunt of wrong decisions of the previous government, he added.\nCiting the statistics, he said while the fiscal deficit of Union Budget was 9.3% for 2020-21, 6.9% for 2021-22, and is estimated at 6.4% this year, Andhra Pradesh registered a deficit of 5.48% and 3.94% during the past two years and yet there are restrictions on FRBM.\nVijayasai Reddy said that the proposed budget for 2022-23 is nearly Rs 40 lakh crore, with an increase of Rs 4.5 lakh crore than that of the last fiscal and the country's growth rate for 2021-22 is at 9.2%. He said this is much better than any other country, especially while fighting COVID-19. Further, he appreciated the increase in capital expenditure by 35% than the previous allocations, where Rs 7.5 lakh crores has been allocated in the current budget which is 20% of the budgetary allocations.\nOn interlinking of rivers Krishna-Godavari, Krishna-Penna, and Penna-Cauvery, he said that the state government had already interlinked Godavari-Krishna Rivers with its own funds and thus, appealed to compensate the state.\nThe state government has been pushing for three development projects which include a dedicated freight corridor from Kharagpur to Vijayawada, freight corridor connectivity to ports in Andhra Pradesh andthe Bhogapuram National Highway, but no announcements were made in this regard, he said. Similarly, he mentioned that no announcements were made towards the development in the healthcare sector.&nbsp;\nIn regard to agriculture, he said that the Union government had completely ignored increasing the allocations of PM Kisan and failed to include tenant farmers under the scheme and also ignored paddy procurement policy and MSP for crops. The YSRCP leader stated that the shortfall in GST compensation of states was not addressed in the budget and appeals to extend the compensation period were ignored.\nHe welcomed an increase of the tax deduction limit of state employees to 14%, and duties' reduction on shrimp production and aquaculture.\nThe YSRCP, however, opposed the privatisation of profit-making public sector units like the LIC, HPCL, VSP and the like. He said there was no encouraging mention of MGNREGS.

The state is still bearing the brunt of wrong decisions of the previous government, he added.\nCiting the statistics, he said while the fiscal deficit of Union Budget was 9.3% for 2020-21, 6.9% for 2021-22, and is estimated at 6.4% this year, Andhra Pradesh registered a deficit of 5.48% and 3.94% during the past two years and yet there are restrictions on FRBM.\nVijayasai Reddy said that the proposed budget for 2022-23 is nearly Rs 40 lakh crore, with an increase of Rs 4.5 lakh crore than that of the last fiscal and the country's growth rate for 2021-22 is at 9.2%. He said this is much better than any other country, especially while fighting COVID-19. Further, he appreciated the increase in capital expenditure by 35% than the previous allocations, where Rs 7.5 lakh crores has been allocated in the current budget which is 20% of the budgetary allocations.\nOn interlinking of rivers Krishna-Godavari, Krishna-Penna, and Penna-Cauvery, he said that the state government had already interlinked Godavari-Krishna Rivers with its own funds and thus, appealed to compensate the state.\nThe state government has been pushing for three development projects which include a dedicated freight corridor from Kharagpur to Vijayawada, freight corridor connectivity to ports in Andhra Pradesh andthe Bhogapuram National Highway, but no announcements were made in this regard, he said. Similarly, he mentioned that no announcements were made towards the development in the healthcare sector.&nbsp;\nIn regard to agriculture, he said that the Union government had completely ignored increasing the allocations of PM Kisan and failed to include tenant farmers under the scheme and also ignored paddy procurement policy and MSP for crops. The YSRCP leader stated that the shortfall in GST compensation of states was not addressed in the budget and appeals to extend the compensation period were ignored.\nHe welcomed an increase of the tax deduction limit of state employees to 14%, and duties' reduction on shrimp production and aquaculture.\nThe YSRCP, however, opposed the privatisation of profit-making public sector units like the LIC, HPCL, VSP and the like. He said there was no encouraging mention of MGNREGS. The budget also has no mention of health insurance to the middle income group which forms over 56%, he said. .\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Wed, 02 Feb 2022 04:29:11 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 2, 4, 29, 11, 2, 33, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Jahnavi""}], ""author"": ""Jahnavi"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Jahnavi""}, ""id"": ""160499 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/union-budget-all-style-no-substance-says-ysrcp-160499#comments""}, {""title"": ""Andhra extends night curfew for two more weeks"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/andhra-feeds"", ""value"": ""Andhra extends night curfew for two more weeks""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/andhra-extends-night-curfew-two-more-weeks-160467""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/andhra-extends-night-curfew-two-more-weeks-160467"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">COVID-19 </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">COVID-19 restrictions mentioned in the previous order issued on January 11 will continue to be in force. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/tnm-staff\"">TNM Staff</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/NightCurfew_Rep_Ahmedabad_07042021_1200x800_PTI.jpg\""><img alt=\""Police personnel stopping people during COVID night curfew: Andhra Pradesh extends night curfew for two more weeks\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/NightCurfew_Rep_Ahmedabad_07042021_1200x800_PTI.jpg?itok=hXt18icM\"" title=\""Police personnel stopping people during COVID night curfew: Andhra Pradesh extends night curfew for two more weeks\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Image for representation/PTI</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The Andhra Pradesh government has further extended the night curfew in place from 11 pm to 5 am by another two weeks, till February 14.

Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan promulgated the AP Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) (Amendment) Ordinance, 2022 to this effect. On January 21, the state Cabinet approved the proposal to amend the AP Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) Act, 1984 in line with the announcement made by Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on January 7.\nIn the Ordinance, the Governor said the amendment to the Act would come into effect from January 1, 2022.

Over the last year, this actor from Bengaluru has been busy with back-to-back projects in Tollywood. She has acted in Uppena, Shyam Singha Roy and Bangarraju. She has three Telugu films coming out as well \u2013 Aa Ammayi Gurinchi Meeku Cheppali, Warrior and Macherla Niyojakavargam. And while busy with her film career, Krithi is also simultaneously doing her graduation in psychology.\nAmidst Krithi\u2019s packed schedule, TNM caught up with her to talk about her journey from ads to films, how Bollywood actor Aamir Khan has inspired her and about her dream roles. Here are some excerpts from the interview:\nWhether it is Sangeetha in Uppena, Keerthy in Shyam Singha Roy or even Naga Lakshmi in Bangarraju, the characters you have played in each movie are very different from each other. On what basis are you choosing roles?\nI haven't taken professional acting classes and I don't have any background in films. So, I choose roles that are different from each other, which will give me wide experience at the beginning of my career. And, by choosing different characters, I want to tell different kinds of stories. I don't want to give the audience the same thing over and over.&nbsp;\nI feel lucky, as directors are approaching me with various kinds of scripts. Usually, my mother and I listen to the script and we decide whether the particular character will suit me or not.&nbsp;\nI am also inspired by Aamir Khan. I really respect him. He delivers different characters with excellence and watching him onscreen you feel like you have got your money\u2019s worth. He really inspires me to give people something new every time.\n\nHow is Alekhya, the character you are playing in your upcoming Telugu film Aa Ammayi Gurinchi Meeku Cheppali, different from previous roles? Going by the teaser of the film, it looks a bit similar to Shyam Singha Roy, as it too shows a director in search of an actor.\nI'm playing the role of an eye doctor in this movie. Though the teaser has little overlapping segments with my previous film, my characterisation and the movie are going to be entirely different and audiences will realise that once they watch the film.\nTo research for this movie, I met with ophthalmologists, saw what they do, how they interact with patients, and the equipment they use. Director Mohan garu helped me a lot with the characterisation.\n\nHow was it working with director Mohana Krishna Indraganti for this movie?\nWorking with him was like being around family. He was very energetic and would notice the smallest things in the actor\u2019s performance and compliment it. I love discussing characterisation and Mohan sir is also the same, so we would spend a lot of time talking about what the character does, what she eats and what she would do in her free time, among other things.\nYou started acting in ad films at a young age and have done over 20 advertisements. Now, you are a part of the film industry, how has the journey been?\nI entered the ad industry when I was around 13 years old. During ad shoots, it was all about being energetic and bubbly and the shoot usually finished in a day. For me, it was about having fun and getting to know people. While I was doing ads, I came to Hyderabad for a shoot a couple of years ago. During that time someone suggested my name for a role in Uppena. That\u2019s how I got my first film. The role gave me the opportunity to try out all kinds of expressions and a range of emotions. I love how in films the roles are so detailed and even the smallest gesture and expression matter.\nWhere do you see yourself five years from now?\nI haven't planned that far ahead, I prefer living in the moment and I am satisfied with what I'm doing now. But I definitely want to be in the industry and continue to entertain people with my performances.\nIs there a dream role you would like to do?\nI want to do roles that challenge me. I am not a very active person when it comes to workouts, although I do love dancing. So, I would like to push myself to do an action role, where there are stunts and fights, which I'm not used to doing. I would also like to be a part of a period drama and play a princess, where getting into the skin of the character requires background research. Both the roles mentioned are different for me, so I would want to take them up.\nTell us about your upcoming projects.\nAa Ammayi Gurinchi Meeku Cheppali is going to be my next film that will come out, then there is Warrior with Ram and Macherla Niyojakavargam with Nithiin. I have been busy with back-to-back movies and filming as well. Now, I want to take things slow and wait for all my current projects to finish. I do not want to miss out on good offers, but I also want to be careful when picking the next film I do.\nAs a newcomer, how has Tollywood treated you?\nAs far as I'm concerned it's a very warm and welcoming industry, whether it is the film fraternity or the fans. This motivates me to give my 100%. Everyone loved my performance in my first movie. I want to maintain this and give back the same love that I have received.\nThere are conversations on pay equity in the industry now. Being a young woman actor, how do you negotiate your salary?\nI feel like times are changing and there is more openness about discussing this now compared to before, from what I have heard, and I'm happy about it. Coming to pay, it depends on the market and the actor\u2019s experience in the industry.\nMany women actors enter the industry when they are very young and discussions have come up regarding consent while filming intimate scenes. This came up during Shyam Singha Roy's release too.\nDuring Shyam Singha Roy, I was not a minor. But during Uppena, I was and they dealt with the intimate scenes with a lot of sensitivity and created a comfortable environment. Camera tricks were used and my mother was there during the shooting. Senior dance master Brindha was there as well and she knew how to handle it. Making the actor comfortable is important as doing such scenes is not easy.\nSai Pallavi intervened on your behalf when a reporter posed an unprofessional question to you about an intimate scene in Shyam Singha Roy. Do you feel entertainment reporters need to be sensitised?\nYes, reporters need to put themselves in our place and see if they would be comfortable if they were asked such questions. It was unnecessary and lacked understanding, which was a little disappointing. Even though we are actors, we are humans with emotions and it's not like we don't get hurt or feel anything when people say something that is disrespectful. Speaking on behalf of all the actors, sensitivity would be appreciated.\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/andhra-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Tollywood</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">In an interview with TNM, actor Krithi Shetty talks about her journey from ads to films, how Bollywood actor Aamir Khan has inspired her and about her dream roles.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/rajeswari-parasa\"">Rajeswari Parasa</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Krithi-Shetty_310122_1200.jpg\""><img alt=\""Actor Krithi Shetty\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Krithi-Shetty_310122_1200.jpg?itok=To9OAL-a\"" title=\""Actor Krithi Shetty\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">When the song \u2018Ishq Shifaya\u2019 from the Telugu film Uppena was released on YouTube last year, audiences were mesmerised by Krithi Shetty who was in it, and once the movie was out they were impressed with her acting skills.

The 14-year-old girl was found dead at her residence in Bhavanipuram area on Saturday, January 29. In a suicide note, which police later recovered from her bedroom, the Class 9 student wrote that she was ending her life due to sexual harassment by Vinod Jain, who resides in the same building.&nbsp;\nPolice have arrested the accused, who contested the recent municipal elections as a corporator on a TDP ticket. Jain had been associated with the TDP from the 37th division of Vijayawada (West) constituency. He has been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He has also been reportedly booked for abetment of suicide.&nbsp;\nThe girl's grandfather Manikyala Rao told the media that she looked disturbed since the morning of January 29 but did not say anything when he enquired. He said when he and his daughter were going for an evening walk, the young girl came to them and hugged her mother to say 'I love you'.\nWhen her grandfather and mother returned home from their walk, they were shocked to learn that she had died by suicide. The grandfather said the police recovered a suicide note from her bedroom in which she wrote how Vinod Jain had been allegedly sexually harassing her.\nMeanwhile, Andhra Pradesh State Women's Commission chairperson Vasireddy Padma said that the government has taken the incident seriously and that all efforts will be made to ensure that the culprit gets stringent punishment.\nEndowments Minister Vellampalli Srinivas, who represents the Vijayawada (West) constituency, termed the incident as shocking and said the government will ensure justice to the victim's family. \""The kind of harassment the girl was subjected to is really shocking. We can't even speak what the girl has written in the suicide note,\"" he said.\nYSRCP legislator and actor RK Roja said that a 60-year-old man sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl and driving her to suicide is a heinous crime. She called upon women to stage protests across the state to seek stringent action against such criminals.

The 14-year-old girl was found dead at her residence in Bhavanipuram area on Saturday, January 29. In a suicide note, which police later recovered from her bedroom, the Class 9 student wrote that she was ending her life due to sexual harassment by Vinod Jain, who resides in the same building.&nbsp;\nPolice have arrested the accused, who contested the recent municipal elections as a corporator on a TDP ticket. Jain had been associated with the TDP from the 37th division of Vijayawada (West) constituency. He has been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. He has also been reportedly booked for abetment of suicide.&nbsp;\nThe girl's grandfather Manikyala Rao told the media that she looked disturbed since the morning of January 29 but did not say anything when he enquired. He said when he and his daughter were going for an evening walk, the young girl came to them and hugged her mother to say 'I love you'.\nWhen her grandfather and mother returned home from their walk, they were shocked to learn that she had died by suicide. The grandfather said the police recovered a suicide note from her bedroom in which she wrote how Vinod Jain had been allegedly sexually harassing her.\nMeanwhile, Andhra Pradesh State Women's Commission chairperson Vasireddy Padma said that the government has taken the incident seriously and that all efforts will be made to ensure that the culprit gets stringent punishment.\nEndowments Minister Vellampalli Srinivas, who represents the Vijayawada (West) constituency, termed the incident as shocking and said the government will ensure justice to the victim's family. \""The kind of harassment the girl was subjected to is really shocking. We can't even speak what the girl has written in the suicide note,\"" he said.\nYSRCP legislator and actor RK Roja said that a 60-year-old man sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl and driving her to suicide is a heinous crime. She called upon women to stage protests across the state to seek stringent action against such criminals. She alleged that during TDP rule many women and children became victims of rapes and sexual harassment.\nMeanwhile, the TDP on Sunday, January 30, suspended Vinod Jain from the party.\nIf you are aware of anyone facing mental health issues or feeling suicidal, please provide help.

DCs, SPs and DDPIs have been asked to keep constant contact with principals, teachers, management of educational institutions and parents.\n\""Action should be taken against the guilty, peace meetings should be held and the High Court order should be followed literally.

The Karnataka High Court, in its interim order pending consideration of all petitions related to the Hijab row, had earlier requested the state government to reopen educational institutions and restrained all the students from wearing saffron shawls, scarves, Hijab and any religious flag within the classroom.\nRead:&nbsp;\nNo religious garments on campuses till we decide case: Karnataka HC on hijab row\nTNM investigation: How Hindutva group mobilised saffron-clad students at Udupi college\nAs protests for and against the hijab intensified in different parts of Karnataka and turned violent in some places, the government declared a holiday for all high schools and colleges in the state for three days, from February 9.&nbsp;\nEarlier in the day, ahead of the reopening of schools, the state government had issued a series of directions to district administrations, aimed at maintaining peace and ensuring that the High Court order is not violated. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai held a meeting with some Ministers, Deputy Commissioners (DCs), Superintendent of Police (SPs), Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPIs) and CEOs of Zilla Panchayats of all districts, via video conferencing, to review the ground situation.\n\""From Monday, high school classes up to class 10 will resume across the state, directions have been issued to see to it that no untoward incident takes place. In sensitive areas, DCs and SPs have to visit campuses and instruct the authorities and teaching staff there to see to it that no untoward incidents take place,\"" Jnanendra told reporters after the meeting. DCs, SPs and DDPIs have been asked to keep constant contact with principals, teachers, management of educational institutions and parents.\n\""Action should be taken against the guilty, peace meetings should be held and the High Court order should be followed literally. Authorities should not budge to any pressure and even small incidents should be considered seriously,\"" he added. Meanwhile, a police flag march was held in Udupi, ahead of the reopening of schools on Monday, February 14.\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 05:20:36 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 12, 5, 20, 36, 5, 43, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Jahnavi""}], ""author"": ""Jahnavi"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Jahnavi""}, ""id"": ""160893 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hijab-row-karnataka-pu-colleges-and-degree-colleges-remain-closed-till-feb-16-160893#comments""}, {""title"": ""Hijab row: No ban on mobile phones at educational institutions, says K'taka Min"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/karnataka-feeds"", ""value"": ""Hijab row: No ban on mobile phones at educational institutions, says K'taka Min""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hijab-row-no-ban-mobile-phones-educational-institutions-says-ktaka-min-160891""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hijab-row-no-ban-mobile-phones-educational-institutions-says-ktaka-min-160891"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Hijab row</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Karnataka&#039;s Higher Education Minister CN Ashwath Narayan was responding to speculation that usage of mobiles will be banned in schools and colleges against the backdrop of hijab row.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/ians\"">IANS</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Ashwath%20Narayan-1200-PTI_0.jpg\""><img alt=\""CN Ashwath Narayan\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Ashwath%20Narayan-1200-PTI_0.jpg?itok=NkC-IcsU\"" title=\""CN Ashwath Narayan\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">pti</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Karnataka's Higher Education Minister C N Ashwath Narayan on Friday said that it would not be possible to ban the usage of phones in colleges as digital learning has become part and parcel of the study process.

This will come as a relief for many Bengalureans, as the PRR is a 117-km road stretch planned by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) that aims to form a sort of loop around Bengaluru, connecting several different areas. The PRR aims to connect Tumakuru road (NH4) in the north-west to Hosur Road (NH7) in the south east of the city passing through several areas in the northern and eastern part of the city.\nThe Karnataka Cabinet on Wednesday also gave an administrative approval for calling tenders to lay 71 kms of the road. The entire project had been delayed for over a decade owing to issues with land acquisition. The Supreme Court had in November 2021 asked the Karnataka government and Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to start acquiring land for the PRR\nThe PRR is aimed to be a six lane bi-directional divided carriageway, which means the road will allow travel in both directions and each side of the road have three lanes.&nbsp;\nThe alignment of the road, according to the pre-feasibility report that was put out by the BDA, will be as follows. The stretch starts at Makali, adjacent to Tumkur road, moves north-east towards Thammenahalli and intersects State Highway (SH) 39 at Soladevanahalli, and some protected land in Kuduregere, Thammenahalli and Soladevanahalli. Further, the road goes through Kempapura and Dodda Bylakere. After Dodda Bylakerethe road goes through a green belt area, passing through Mavallipura sewage treatment plant, before entering Jarakabande Kaval forest.\nIt then intersects Doddaballapur road near BMS Institute of Technology, around 3 km from the periphery of Yelahanka Satellite Town. Passing through KEB layout, the road goes further east intersecting Bellary road (NH 7) at Hosahalli. The road then goes to Kogilu, and moves south along Agrahara, Thirumalenahalli, Bellahalli, DoddagubbiIn and then goes through Ramapura.\nFurther south-east, the road traverses Hirandahalli and intersects Old Madras Road (NH 4) near Sree Mahalakshmi Venkateswara School in Avalahalli. From Avalahalli, the road passes near Weavers Colony, and goes further down to intersect SH-35 near Govt Primary School in Shigehalli. It then goes through Kumbena Agrahara towards Kadugodi. In Kadugodi, the PRR intersects the railway line near Kadugodi Milk Federation Society. Moving down, it cuts across Channasandra main road and curves west through Nagondanahalli and Hagaduru. It then goes through Sorahunase and Varthur.\nIn Varthur, the road goes further down and intersects SH-35 near Kachamaranahalli. Around 3.5 kms further southwest, it cuts across Sarjapur road in Sulikunte. The road then curves south-west towards Gattahalli, Huskuru and Chikkanagamangala. Going further south-west, the road moves along the periphery of the industrial areas of Electronic City. It enters Electronic City and intersects with Hosur Road (NH-7) near Suvidya College in Hebbagodi.\nThe current estimated cost of the PRR, according to an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court by the Karnataka government, is Rs 21,091 crore as of December 2020. Out of the total cost, Rs 15,475 crore will be just for the land acquisition process and the remaining Rs 5,616 crore will be for the actual construction of the road.\nThe government in the November 2021 affidavit also stated that the project is proposed to be taken up under the PPP-DBFOT (Public Private Partnership \u2013 Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer) mode. It further stated that there is a proposal to call for global tenders.\nAccording to the affidavit, a total of 216 acres and 18 guntas of government lands were notified by BDA through a notification dated June 29, 2007.

The issue, which has made headlines not only across the state but across India and even reached the Supreme Court, is currently being heard by a three-judge bench of the Karnataka High Court. In an interim order, the HC has barred wearing of religious attires like the hijab or saffron shawls on campus till a further order.&nbsp;\nThe faculty members, Ritwik Banerjee, Deepak Malghan, Dalhia Mani, Prateek Raj and Hema Swaminathan, in their email to Rekha Sharma, the Commission Chairperson said, \u201cWe urge the National Commission for Women (NCW) to exercise its powers and urgently take suo moto cognisance of reports of intimidation of Muslim women students based on religious attire. Women across all religions face patriarchal restrictions of one kind or the other. Certainly, we cannot condone such practices and we must work with men, women, and religious leaders to bring about change. But to single out one religious practice is not acceptable.\u201d\nThe petition addressed to the NCW by the IIM-B professors noted that the Karnataka High Court is hearing the issue but expressed their concern about the threat to safety and dignity of the Muslim women in the current context.&nbsp;\nThey said the \u201catmosphere of fear and intimidation\u201d will make the parents of these students hesitate about sending them to school and the government\u2019s mission of educating girl children.&nbsp; \u201cBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao will be an abject failure, not just for Muslim girls, but for girls across all communities.

The issue, which has made headlines not only across the state but across India and even reached the Supreme Court, is currently being heard by a three-judge bench of the Karnataka High Court. In an interim order, the HC has barred wearing of religious attires like the hijab or saffron shawls on campus till a further order.&nbsp;\nThe faculty members, Ritwik Banerjee, Deepak Malghan, Dalhia Mani, Prateek Raj and Hema Swaminathan, in their email to Rekha Sharma, the Commission Chairperson said, \u201cWe urge the National Commission for Women (NCW) to exercise its powers and urgently take suo moto cognisance of reports of intimidation of Muslim women students based on religious attire. Women across all religions face patriarchal restrictions of one kind or the other. Certainly, we cannot condone such practices and we must work with men, women, and religious leaders to bring about change. But to single out one religious practice is not acceptable.\u201d\nThe petition addressed to the NCW by the IIM-B professors noted that the Karnataka High Court is hearing the issue but expressed their concern about the threat to safety and dignity of the Muslim women in the current context.&nbsp;\nThey said the \u201catmosphere of fear and intimidation\u201d will make the parents of these students hesitate about sending them to school and the government\u2019s mission of educating girl children.&nbsp; \u201cBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao will be an abject failure, not just for Muslim girls, but for girls across all communities. Failure of law and rule of intimidation affects everyone,\u201d they said.\nThey also quoted the NCW mission statement of \u201cenabling women to achieve equality and equal participation in all spheres of life by securing her due rights and entitlements..\u201d and urged that the NCW take urgent steps in this regard.

Rachel had sustained serious injuries in the incident and had been receiving treatment in hospital since then. She passed away on Thursday, a statement by the hospital said.\nOn March 11, 2020, Rachel was going to school with her father on a two-wheeler when suddenly a dry tree branch fell on her head at TC Palya main road in the city. The branch fell off a tree that was supposed to have been cleared by the Bengaluru civic body \u2014 the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Severely injured, Rachel was rushed to Manipal hospital, where she remained admitted for the next two years.\nIn a statement, Manipal hospital said that she was brought to the hospital in a critical condition and was admitted to the paediatric ICU. During treatment, she underwent intensive neurorehabilitation treatment, the hospital said. \u201cEven with the best of the care, her recovery was very poor and she continued to be in a persistent vegetative state. She was completely dependent on caregivers for all her activities of daily living,\u201d the hospital added in a statement.\n\u201cHer stay in the hospital was complicated by multiple episodes of severe sepsis and repeated ICU admissions. She recently developed a severe chest infection and sepsis. Ms Rachael Prischa succumbed to the infection on 10.02.22,\u201d the statement by the hospital added.\nRachel\u2019s parents had, at the time, said that this would not have happened if the BBMP had cleared the tree on time. After the incident in 2020, an FIR was filed by the Bengaluru police against BBMP officials. However, since the BBMP offered to pay for the child\u2019s treatment, they did not press charges for police action. Now, the police are likely to modify the FIR and add charges of death by negligence.\nOn Thursday, after Rachel\u2019s death, Former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy visited the hospital and paid his condolences to the bereaved family. \""Am really pained by Rachael's demise.

The reserve forest spread across 613 hectares is home to a plethora of birds and animals. And over the last few years, birdwatchers have started noticing more peacocks \u2013 the male birds prancing around with their fan of blue and green feathers, the smaller females with their grey and brown plumage. It has also become a common sight for residents living near the hills to find peacocks perched on trees near their homes and to hear their distinct squawk.&nbsp; \u201cEarlier, we never used to see peacocks in the area, but over the last five to six years we are seeing peacocks in Chamundi Hills,\u201d says Bhagya, who has been a resident of Tavarekatte, which lies on the edge of the hills, for the past 30 years.\nLocals also say that peacocks are sighted in good numbers in plantations close to the hills, where they come early in the mornings to quench their thirst. So, what has led to this sudden increase in peacocks in these hills? And as the area around the reserve forest gives way to more residential buildings, what does it mean for the peacock population?\nBeing a scrub forest, Chamundi Hills is home to animals like leopards, wild pigs and monitor lizards. It is also a place where you can spot a variety of local and migratory birds like bulbuls, sunbirds, drongos and flycatchers \u2013 making it a must-visit for birdwatchers. \u201cWe have doused forest fires as and when they occurred making the hills safe during the summer. Besides, water holes were created so birds can quench their thirst,\u201d says a forest officer, to explain the number of birds that are found in the hills. While forest officials, too, have noticed an increase in the number of peacocks,&nbsp;no official count has been done, according to the Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF) Kamala Karikalan.\nThe DCF adds, \u201cThe peacocks may have found the place conducive to settle and their population has grown. We have planted fruit-bearing trees in forest areas including Chamundi Hills and de-silted water holes which may have contributed to the increase in numbers.\u201d\nMaharaj, a resident of Lalithadripura, another village on the edge of the hills, is an avid bird watcher and also acknowledges that there has been a rise in peacock numbers over the last five years. He says that ever since the hills have been fenced off and a vegetative green cover has grown over the forest, the peacock population has thrived.\nHe also points out, \u201cPeople from nearby villages used to venture into the hills to collect firewood but with the thick vegetative cover and the presence of some leopards, they are too afraid to enter the hills. The lack of disturbance might be another reason for the rise in peacock numbers.\u201d\nHowever, Maharaj worries that the foraging ground for peacocks has reduced to a great extent and this might affect the bird population. Earlier, farmers close to the hills used to grow ragi, jowar and lilva beans among others, and peacocks used to come there and feed on insects, small creatures, seeds, and reptiles. But now, with residential layouts replacing these farms and agricultural lands, the peacocks have very little space to forage around the hills and this could threaten their numbers in the long run, according to Maharaj.\n\nChamundi Hills isn\u2019t the only place to see an increase in the number of peacocks. Shivaprakash, who is part of Mysore Nature, an organisation made up of amateur naturalists and birdwatchers, says. \u201cThe population of peacocks has gone up in the last 15 years or so in the areas surrounding Mysuru. Earlier, one had to travel to Mahadevapura, about 20 km from Mysuru, to sight a peacock. But, nowadays, peacocks are regular visitors to residential areas of Ramakrishnanagar, Lingambudi Lake area and other adjoining areas of the city.\u201d\nBut Shivaprakash isn\u2019t worried about the dwindling foraging areas in and around Chamundi Hills. He says that peacocks are good at coexisting with humans. \u201cSome birds like cattle egrets, peacocks, and sparrows are known to live alongside humans because these birds are adventurous in nature,\u201d he says. He adds that peacock numbers won\u2019t reduce as long as people do not disturb them.\nGirisha is a freelancer who writes on forests and wildlife.\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/karnataka-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Environment</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Chamundi Hills, near Mysuru, is home to animals like leopards and monitor lizards, and supports a variety of local and migratory birds. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/girisha\"">Girisha</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Peacock_PTI_11022022_1200.jpg\""><img alt=\""PTI\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Peacock_PTI_11022022_1200.jpg?itok=GUdUFOhu\"" title=\""PTI\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Image for representaion/PTI</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Chamundi Hills, near Mysuru, is a nature lover\u2019s paradise.

What started as a voice of assertion of their Muslim identity by one group of girls in a government pre-university college in Udupi has now spread across the state, with a legal battle raging in the Karnataka High Court, that will dictate a lot in terms of religious and person freedoms for not just Karnataka, but the rest of the country as well. So how did this saffron movement against the hijab start spreading, and who were the driving forces?&nbsp;\nTNM has pieced together the timeline of events leading up to the widespread protests that the state saw on Tuesday, February 8. And what emerges is not the story of a spontaneous student movement, but a calculated Hindutva plot that has built on years of communal polarisation in Karnataka to mobilise students. In over 25 colleges, the protests by those opposing hijab were conspicuously similar \u2013 identical saffron scarfs, \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 chants, and the use of similar language in their opposition to hijab in classrooms. While some Hindutva organisations like the Hindu Jagarana Vedike (HJV), Bajrang Dal and Hindu Janajagruti Samiti asked students affiliated to them to organise the protests, they have also managed to bring students who have so far not been part of any such movements, into their fold.&nbsp;\n\n\tA timeline of saffron protests\nFor many high school and pre-university (PUC) students in Karnataka, physical classes started in July 2021, after over a year of educational institutions being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021, a group of students at the Government PU College for girls in Udupi, petitioned the college authorities to wear the hijab inside their classrooms, and when the college refused, it led to a string of events.&nbsp;\nBy January 6, two saffron protests happened \u2014 at a college in Aikala in Mangaluru and another in Chikamagalur, where a group of students wore saffron scarves and said they will wear the Hindutva symbol to classes if Muslim girls are allowed to wear the hijab.&nbsp;\nAt the Chikamagalur college, protests have happened on and off since then, but the issue did not become bigger till the girls from the Government PU College for girls in Udupi went to court demanding their rights. The petition was filed by the students on January 31.&nbsp;\n\nIn less than a week after the HC started hearing the case, anti-hijab protests spread across Karnataka. As of February 9, saffron-clad students have protested in at least 12 districts in the state, including Chikmagalur, Hassan, Tumakuru, Mandya, Kalaburagi, Bagalkot, Haveri, Belagavi and Vijayapura.&nbsp;\n\nAs the hijab wearing girls in Udupi PU college were not allowed to enter classes and girls in hijab were barred from another college in Kundapur, Kalaburagi saw a protest on February 6 organised by Congress MLA of Kalaburgi North Kaneez Fathima demanding that the hijab wearing students in Udupi should be allowed to attend classes.&nbsp;\n\n\tHow Hindutva groups organised students\nIn response, the Government PU College in Afzalpur taluk saw students wearing saffron shawls, protesting against seven students who wore hijab. This protest was organised by Sri Rama Sene and students.\nSiddalinga Swamy of the Sri Rama Sene said that they wanted to counter the narrative of allowing hijab in classes. \u201cOur student wing also took part, we managed to gather a total of 150 students for the protest,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are running a campaign, urging students to put pressure on the education department and college authorities to enforce strict uniform in which hijab will not be allowed. To educate the students on this, we had called for a meeting on Sunday and gave instructions. We will continue the rest using social media,\u201d he added.&nbsp;\n\nAfter the protest, the college authorities convinced five of the seven students to remove their hijab and attend classes.&nbsp;\nWhile Sri Rama Sene took the lead in Kalaburagi, it was the Hindu Jagarana Vedike (HJV) that led protests at Vijayapura district\u2019s GRB Degree College. Like elsewhere in the state, saffron shawls were used to oppose Muslim students wearing hijab in classes. Mahantesh, who was one of the students who wore a saffron shawl, said that the students of the college went to the Hindu Jagarana Vedike for \u2018guidance to counter the conspiracy\u2019 by those who were insisting on wearing hijabs in classrooms.&nbsp;\n\u201cA group of around 25 students wanted to show our solidarity with what is happening across the state. So we called the local HJV activist to ask how we can help. He was our senior from college so we met him,\u201d he tells TNM. \u201cHe told us to follow the same model that others are following: insist on wearing saffron shawls in classrooms till they stop wearing hijabs. He also invited us to a sabhe (meeting) of HJV over the weekend so we can get more involved with such causes,\u201d Mahantesh said.&nbsp;\nIn colleges in Hassan, the protesting students say they \u2018drew inspiration\u2019 from ABVP members. Praveen who studies in the Hassan Government Science College says that they had been following the developments in colleges in Udupi closely. And when the issue refused to die down, \u2018some ABVP friends\u2019 suggested that they too should join the protest. \u201cThey (ABVP members) are our friends and brothers. They showed us how, if we come together, we can fight for equality. Why should only Muslim girls be allowed to deviate from the uniform?\u201d Praveen asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn the neighbouring district of Chikmagalur, too, organisations like the ABVP and HJV have been at the forefront of these protests, but on record, no one wants to take credit. While Shashi Aldur, district coordinator of ABVP, said that the organisation was not involved, he was simultaneously adamant that protests would continue irrespective of the High Court verdict. \u201cNo matter what the verdict is, even if one student wears a hijab we will continue with the protests. This will spread to every district in Karnataka,\u201d he said.\nIn Mandya, from where the video of a lone Muslim student in burqa being heckled by a group of male students donning saffron shawls and chanting \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 has now gone viral, student Whatsapp groups were used to mobilise the crowd. TNM spoke to Umesh, a final year B.Com student who was one among protesters who targeted Muskan, a student in Mandya\u2019s PES College of Arts, Science and Commerce. Umesh said that they were not allowed to wear saffron shawls in college on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanthi in April last year. \u201cWe used the WhatsApp groups that were already formed for classes, to coordinate the protests. We did crowd-sourcing and pooled in money to buy saffron shawls. People gave money ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 1,000, as per their capacity, and we used this,\u201d he added.&nbsp;\n\n\tAnti-hijab sentiment as a flashpoint for further Hindutva recruitment\nWhile Bajrang Dal, VHP and Hindu Jagarana Vedike members have been seen openly encouraging students to protest, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) \u2014 student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) \u2014 has chosen to distance itself from the protests. On February 9, the ABVP said students are using both saffron shawls and hijab as weapons against each other and appealed to students to stop wearing both. The ABVP asked students to wear their uniforms and focus on education.&nbsp;\nRead: Muslim students in hijabs endure unwanted glare of media and cameras in Karnataka\nAishwarya Shetty, ABVP\u2019s Karnataka state joint secretary said that they were not behind any of the protests. However, on further prodding, she said that WhatsApp groups were used to \u2018create awareness\u2019 among students and they were asked to organise themselves.\n\u201cThe students wearing saffron shawls are not just ABVP members but all Hindu students. When students wear the saffron shawl, they are reminded of great personalities like Swami Vivekananda, Pejawar Sri and others,\u201d she told TNM.&nbsp;\nThere is an element of truth to Aishwarya\u2019s assertion. Across the three districts that this reporter travelled in, many students \u2014 both Hindu and Muslim \u2014 who had joined the protests, had no affiliation to any student groups.\n\u201cWe are not members of any Hindu organisations so far, but what is wrong with them supporting us?\u201d asked Chandra, a student of IDSG Government College, Chikmagalur. \u201cMany students who are protesting with us are members of ABVP, HJV and Bajrang Dal. They are helping us (Hindus) fight back,\u201d he added.&nbsp;\nSanthosh (name changed) was a part of the saffron protest in Koppa in Chikmagalur. \u201cSaffron shawls are a part of our religion. All these organisations (Hindu organisations) have been working towards Hindu pride so they just point us in the right direction. They showed us how, if we keep getting oppressed, we will never get our rights,\u201d he added. He however admitted that the protests were primarily organised by Vinay Shivapura, a student of the Government First Grade College who is a prominent member of the ABVP.&nbsp;\nAs the Hindu students were being organised, protests by Muslim organisations and communities were also sporadically seen across the state. Protests were held by Muslims, particularly women from the community, against the hijab ban in colleges in districts like Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Mysuru, Chikmagalur, Chamarajanagar, Hubbali, Mandya, Belagavi, Chitradurga, Vijayapura and Kalaburagi. Some of the protests were attended and organised by members of political outfits like the Students' Federation of India (SFI) and Campus Front of India (CFI).\nAn SFI leader in the region said that ABVP has been polarising students in Karnataka for many years now. \u201cRoutinely, they share hate messages against Muslims and even Christians on student WhatsApp groups,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is laughable if ABVP says they are not organising protests. They have been tutoring students on how to oppose other faiths. They give instructions about what to say when the media speaks to them, how to handle when lecturers don\u2019t allow them in classes. They clearly assure them of support if students get into trouble because of these protests.\u201d\nRead: TNM investigation: How Hindutva group mobilised saffron-clad students at Udupi college\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/karnataka-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Controversy</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">TNM spoke to dozens of people involved in the saffron protests \u2014 including those who are pulling the strings in the background. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/pooja-prasanna\"">Pooja Prasanna</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/MainSaffronProtests_100222_1200.jpg\""><img alt=\""A representative picture of protests by wearing saffron shawls, picture from protest in Chikamagalur \"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/MainSaffronProtests_100222_1200.jpg?itok=0zchQWD1\"" title=\""How the Karnataka anti-hijab protests were part of a calculated plot across the state\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Visuals of students in saffron scarves and turbans protesting, chanting \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019, and in some cases heckling their classmates in hijab have consumed our screens in the past week.

Why should only Muslim girls be allowed to deviate from the uniform?\u201d Praveen asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn the neighbouring district of Chikmagalur, too, organisations like the ABVP and HJV have been at the forefront of these protests, but on record, no one wants to take credit. While Shashi Aldur, district coordinator of ABVP, said that the organisation was not involved, he was simultaneously adamant that protests would continue irrespective of the High Court verdict. \u201cNo matter what the verdict is, even if one student wears a hijab we will continue with the protests. This will spread to every district in Karnataka,\u201d he said.\nIn Mandya, from where the video of a lone Muslim student in burqa being heckled by a group of male students donning saffron shawls and chanting \u2018Jai Sri Ram\u2019 has now gone viral, student Whatsapp groups were used to mobilise the crowd. TNM spoke to Umesh, a final year B.Com student who was one among protesters who targeted Muskan, a student in Mandya\u2019s PES College of Arts, Science and Commerce. Umesh said that they were not allowed to wear saffron shawls in college on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanthi in April last year. \u201cWe used the WhatsApp groups that were already formed for classes, to coordinate the protests. We did crowd-sourcing and pooled in money to buy saffron shawls. People gave money ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 1,000, as per their capacity, and we used this,\u201d he added.&nbsp;\n\n\tAnti-hijab sentiment as a flashpoint for further Hindutva recruitment\nWhile Bajrang Dal, VHP and Hindu Jagarana Vedike members have been seen openly encouraging students to protest, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) \u2014 student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) \u2014 has chosen to distance itself from the protests. On February 9, the ABVP said students are using both saffron shawls and hijab as weapons against each other and appealed to students to stop wearing both. The ABVP asked students to wear their uniforms and focus on education.&nbsp;\nRead: Muslim students in hijabs endure unwanted glare of media and cameras in Karnataka\nAishwarya Shetty, ABVP\u2019s Karnataka state joint secretary said that they were not behind any of the protests. However, on further prodding, she said that WhatsApp groups were used to \u2018create awareness\u2019 among students and they were asked to organise themselves.\n\u201cThe students wearing saffron shawls are not just ABVP members but all Hindu students. When students wear the saffron shawl, they are reminded of great personalities like Swami Vivekananda, Pejawar Sri and others,\u201d she told TNM.&nbsp;\nThere is an element of truth to Aishwarya\u2019s assertion. Across the three districts that this reporter travelled in, many students \u2014 both Hindu and Muslim \u2014 who had joined the protests, had no affiliation to any student groups.\n\u201cWe are not members of any Hindu organisations so far, but what is wrong with them supporting us?\u201d asked Chandra, a student of IDSG Government College, Chikmagalur. \u201cMany students who are protesting with us are members of ABVP, HJV and Bajrang Dal. They are helping us (Hindus) fight back,\u201d he added.&nbsp;\nSanthosh (name changed) was a part of the saffron protest in Koppa in Chikmagalur. \u201cSaffron shawls are a part of our religion. All these organisations (Hindu organisations) have been working towards Hindu pride so they just point us in the right direction. They showed us how, if we keep getting oppressed, we will never get our rights,\u201d he added. He however admitted that the protests were primarily organised by Vinay Shivapura, a student of the Government First Grade College who is a prominent member of the ABVP.&nbsp;\nAs the Hindu students were being organised, protests by Muslim organisations and communities were also sporadically seen across the state. Protests were held by Muslims, particularly women from the community, against the hijab ban in colleges in districts like Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Mysuru, Chikmagalur, Chamarajanagar, Hubbali, Mandya, Belagavi, Chitradurga, Vijayapura and Kalaburagi. Some of the protests were attended and organised by members of political outfits like the Students' Federation of India (SFI) and Campus Front of India (CFI).\nAn SFI leader in the region said that ABVP has been polarising students in Karnataka for many years now. \u201cRoutinely, they share hate messages against Muslims and even Christians on student WhatsApp groups,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is laughable if ABVP says they are not organising protests. They have been tutoring students on how to oppose other faiths. They give instructions about what to say when the media speaks to them, how to handle when lecturers don\u2019t allow them in classes. They clearly assure them of support if students get into trouble because of these protests.\u201d\nRead: TNM investigation: How Hindutva group mobilised saffron-clad students at Udupi college\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Thu, 10 Feb 2022 13:32:09 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 10, 13, 32, 9, 3, 41, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""PoojaP""}], ""author"": ""PoojaP"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""PoojaP""}, ""id"": ""160846 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/how-karnataka-anti-hijab-protests-were-part-calculated-plot-across-state-160846#comments""}, {""title"": ""No religious garments on campuses till we decide case: Karnataka HC on hijab row"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/karnataka-feeds"", ""value"": ""No religious garments on campuses till we decide case: Karnataka HC on hijab row""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/no-religious-garments-campuses-till-we-decide-case-karnataka-hc-hijab-row-160841""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/no-religious-garments-campuses-till-we-decide-case-karnataka-hc-hijab-row-160841"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Court</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The High Court said it will issue an interim order that high schools and colleges in the state \u2014 which were asked to stay closed till Friday, February 11 \u2014 should reopen but nobody should be allowed to wear any kind of religious clothing. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/sanyukta-dharmadhikari\"">Sanyukta Dharmadhikari</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/KarnatakaHighCourt_Hijab_Isuue_9022022_1200.jpeg\""><img alt=\""Karnataka hijab row: Hijab-wearing students with the Karnataka High Court in the background\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/KarnatakaHighCourt_Hijab_Isuue_9022022_1200.jpeg?itok=KU55SS5V\"" title=\""Karnataka hijab row: Hijab-wearing students with the Karnataka High Court in the background\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The Karnataka High Court on Thursday, February 10, restrained students from wearing any kind of religious clothing, be it a headscarf or saffron shawls, to high schools and colleges as it is still hearing the case.

The strict lockdown measures meant that her mother could not even reach a hospital to deliver her. \u201cShe was like any other baby at first, but gradually her head began to grow bigger,\u201d recalled her step-sister Susheela over a phone call. After a tragically short life, Harshitha died on February 2, 2022 while she was under treatment in Calicut medical college. \u201cFor a year she used to smile at us when we called her name. That smile ended as her head kept growing and became softer and her hands and legs remained stiff,\u201d Susheela explained. Harshitha was suffering from a disorder called Hydrocephalus, a condition that several endosulfan infected children are suffering from.\nKumbadaje, the village Harshitha\u2019s family belongs to, has just one primary health centre (PHC). \u201cIt costs us Rs 100 to reach the PHC by auto. Harshitha was not included in the list of endosulfan victims as the medical camps to update the list of newborn victims are no longer being conducted. We were told in Kasargod district hospital that these camps stopped years ago,\u201d Susheela said.\nKasargod district is demanding to be seen. An indefinite hunger strike began on January 13, 2022 demanding a branch of AIIMS in the district as many believe this will improve the health situation of the many endosulfan victims in the district. When the union budget did not announce any AIIMS in Kerala, locals blamed the state government stating that if Kasargod district was pushed as one of the places to set up AIIMS, then it would have been approved.\nThe rising frustration is understandable. From December 28, 2021 to February 2, 2022 three endosulfan affected children died in the district. The AIIMS for Kasargod People's Collective sees these deaths as facilitated by the government. Two of those, Ameya and Harshitha, under five years of age, were not included in the endosulfan victims\u2019 list. The third, eleven years old Muhammed Ismail was included in the list, but no health camps have been conducted here since 2017.\nThe demand for AIIMS stems from the fact that there are still undiagnosed conditions children are born into. Five-year old Ameya was taken to Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology where she was prescribed two scans, first for treatment and another to see its impact. On December 27, 2021 with severe vomiting, Ameya was admitted to District Hospital in Kanhangad, but the doctors were clueless, said Fareena Kottappuram a school teacher and general convener of the collective at a press meet held on February 3. Ameya was then shifted to the ICU as there was no time left to take her to another hospital, where she died.\n\nSignature campaign at protest site\nTwo years of COVID 19 has broken the health logistics that generations of endosulfan victims relied upon. The dependency on both private and government hospitals in neighbouring state Karnataka came to almost an end. The lack of a multispecialty hospital as recommended by the Supreme Court, pushed them to rely upon the next hospital in proximity, within Kerala. Several patients in need of physiotherapy were limited to their beds. Surgeries were either postponed or medicines continued and only painkillers were administered. When the national lockdown was imposed, the state government did not initiate any special rehabilitation project for the endosulfan victims. To make matters worse, their pensions were delayed. This led to another protest.\n\""There is no other district where people have died on the road gasping, because they did not get treatment. At this point we realised that we have nothing in terms of health infrastructure,\u201d says social activist Ambalathara Kunjikrishnan, who had been in the forefront of anti-endosulfan agitation. \u201cWe realised we need to have a research oriented medical facility to find out the problems these children are facing, which is why we demand AIIMS. Three children who died recently belong to Scheduled Caste communities,\u201d Kunjikrishnan notes. In 2014, five MLAs filed a petition with the Oommen Chandy government demanding to add Kasargod to the proposed list for AIIMS. But the government included Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. In 2017 an all party committee met the chief minister, but were told that only Calicut would be considered. \u201cKasargod is the most backward district in the state. Interior villages like Bayar, Panathur etc. are denied better medical care and people of these villages have joined this protest\u201d Zubair, a People\u2019s Democratic Party leader said.\n\n\tThe right to health\n\u201cIt was Kasargod district that was selected for a large scale cashew production as cashew factories were mushrooming in Kollam district. Cashew trees were extensively planted in both inhabited areas and isolated regions alike and the pesticide use was the easiest way for the state to ramp up cashew production.\nThis aerial strike has polluted rivers, rivulets, streams, ponds and wells. People who consumed water from these died early of cancerous diseases. It breaks our heart to see the new born babies who are born with diseases. Even after two to three decades, children with endosulfan-caused diseases are born, they die.&nbsp; Isn\u2019t it the government's responsibility to solve this issue permanently? An ordinary medical college that isn\u2019t functional yet is no solution. It is not mercy. For the district, it is a right to have AIIMS, an independent institute where the most modern, free treatments are available,\u201d a pamphlet distributed at the AIIMS People\u2019s Collective reads.\nSumathi, mother of eleven-year old Mithun who is living with six severe conditions, says that there are several cases that go unreported. She belongs to Mavilan, a Scheduled Tribe community. In October 2021, during an interview she told that she feels her pain is less while thinking about mothers who have three to four children who are endosulfan infected.\nMithun has been diagnosed with microcephaly, mixed cerebral palsy, global developmental delay, organic acidemia, grade IV PEM Marasmus, and severe hearing loss. He was not able to sleep till he was four years old. It was only after he started getting physiotherapy that he began to sleep. Sumathi opined the political parties are not unified for the cause due to health infrastructure. \u201cThere are many who aren\u2019t included in the list. We were assured that the list will be updated. It looks like the government does not want to accept the fact that many children are affected. If the district collector (Dr Sajith Babu) made a report saying that people who aren\u2019t endosulfan affected are included in the list, it is the fault of the process itself. It takes a lot of process to be on the list, doctors and experts are included\u201d Sumathi said.\n\n\tNeutralising the endosulfan stock\nKunjikrshnan says that endosulfan is just a representative of pesticide companies. Post the pesticide tragedy and ban, Kasaragod district was declared as bio district. \u201cThe companies are afraid that the district will reach a phase that says an absolute no to the pesticides. The district collector Dr Sajith Babu gave an interview that endosulfan can be consumed like water and he said nothing happened because of the pesticide. The collector said there are non deserving individuals in the list. He claims that there are cases in which diseases are cured. He is an agriculturalist and cannot claim to be an expert about diseases. He was aiming to find individuals whose medical conditions are cured, to claim that the rest are invalid. There is a conspiracy behind this to bring back the pesticide\u201d he stated. When asked about the remaining endosulfan stock that is still in the district, he said, \u201cThe endosulfan stock is kept in Plantation Corporation\u2019s three godowns at Periya, Cheemeni and Rajapuram since the pesticide was banned in 2000. In 2012, the barrels broke and there was a leakage in the Cheemeni warehouse. We demanded that it be neutralised. Around 1,600 litres of endosulfan had an expiry date in 2017. The then district collector Jithendran had assured us that this will be shifted to new barrels. But five years have passed. We demanded the pesticide be taken back to the company and the neutralisation done in a scientific manner. But in 2021 October they made a move to secretly bury the pesticide in a pit, spending Rs 43 lakhs. We protested again. The present collector is aware of things and assured that they would conduct studies. The people of Kasargod can\u2019t stand another experiment.\u201d\n\n\tCan we say Kerala Number One?\nDr YS Mohan Kumar, while working in Swarga village, found out that there was an increase in diseases in the 1990s and realised the dangers of endosulfan. While working as a doctor, he published research findings about this in medical journals. Speaking of the present conditions in Kasargod\u2019s health infrastructure, he says that Kerala being number one model is an unreal claim.\n\u201cA new medical college is being built at Ukkinadka. It has been four years since construction began and no attempt is being made to speed up the work. The service of good specialists and doctors must be made useful here. Without developing the infrastructure can we say Kerala is Number one?\u201d Dr Mohan Kumar asked.\n\u201cKerala model is a media propaganda. Rural health infrastructure must be developed, urban dwellers are not the only ones who deserve health facilities. I stay forty kilometres interior from the main road. We don\u2019t have a good road. Last year, a child who got an electric shock died without getting any medical aid. In the hilly areas of Kasargod\u2019s interior, we only have primary health centres. We have one in Badiadka. It is not functioning full time. In Karnataka, there are CHCs that function round the clock. In number one Kerala the service is available only till 2 pm. Where should we go after 2 pm?\u201d he questioned.\nMuneesa, who has visual disability and gynaecological issues due to endosulfan, is a front leader running a rehabilitation centre named \u2018Sneha Veedu\u2019 for children with disabilities.\n\u201cFor a majority of people, going to the hospital is a huge task. Going to Trivandrum and returning takes twenty six hours for us by train. They make us run from hospital to hospital. If the government has the will to facilitate our demands it wouldn\u2019t take much of a time. Each life is valuable. For the mother, the child is as important with or without disabilities. Doctors are frustrated because they do not have enough facilities to treat us. The TATA sponsored COVID hospital was built in three months. Why is there a delay of ten years in the medical college construction?\u201d Muneesa asks.\nIn 2016, Thiruvananthapuram based NGO Satya Sai Trust proposed a two hundred bed specialty hospital in Kasargod. The project was launched in 2018. The trust has also built 45 houses in five acres of land in Eriya near Periya, but the allocation of these houses to the beneficiary families are yet to be fulfilled. The procedure has to be done through the Special Cell for Rehabilitation of endosulfan victims, which has not met for more than a&nbsp; year.\nMuneesa thinks that the Kerala legislative assembly\u2019s recent decision to appoint two more neurologists in Kasargod district is a result of the ongoing protest for AIIMS. She keeps receiving calls from mothers of endosulfan affected children when there is a medical emergency. A mother couldn\u2019t find a facility even in Kannur for an MRI scan for her son and had to contact a hospital in Mangaluru, but it could be done only with an RT PCR test result. \u201cIt requires staying there for a day and getting the tests done. The parents are not financially well off to do it.&nbsp; After I discussed it in a state committee group for welfare, a person arranged the facility at a hospital in Kannur. But this is just for a child. How long and how many children can survive like this? A Supreme Court verdict exists that says medical facilities should be facilitated by the state government\u201d she said.\n\nThe Kasargod Government medical college under construction\nKasargod medical college now has a neurosurgeon who is available thrice a week. \u201cNow facilities are available for the endosulfan affected community in the medical college like seizure management, epilepsy, and treatment for infections. The medical college is functioning as a temporary outpatient department.

The strict lockdown measures meant that her mother could not even reach a hospital to deliver her. \u201cShe was like any other baby at first, but gradually her head began to grow bigger,\u201d recalled her step-sister Susheela over a phone call. After a tragically short life, Harshitha died on February 2, 2022 while she was under treatment in Calicut medical college. \u201cFor a year she used to smile at us when we called her name. That smile ended as her head kept growing and became softer and her hands and legs remained stiff,\u201d Susheela explained. Harshitha was suffering from a disorder called Hydrocephalus, a condition that several endosulfan infected children are suffering from.\nKumbadaje, the village Harshitha\u2019s family belongs to, has just one primary health centre (PHC). \u201cIt costs us Rs 100 to reach the PHC by auto. Harshitha was not included in the list of endosulfan victims as the medical camps to update the list of newborn victims are no longer being conducted. We were told in Kasargod district hospital that these camps stopped years ago,\u201d Susheela said.\nKasargod district is demanding to be seen. An indefinite hunger strike began on January 13, 2022 demanding a branch of AIIMS in the district as many believe this will improve the health situation of the many endosulfan victims in the district. When the union budget did not announce any AIIMS in Kerala, locals blamed the state government stating that if Kasargod district was pushed as one of the places to set up AIIMS, then it would have been approved.\nThe rising frustration is understandable. From December 28, 2021 to February 2, 2022 three endosulfan affected children died in the district. The AIIMS for Kasargod People's Collective sees these deaths as facilitated by the government. Two of those, Ameya and Harshitha, under five years of age, were not included in the endosulfan victims\u2019 list. The third, eleven years old Muhammed Ismail was included in the list, but no health camps have been conducted here since 2017.\nThe demand for AIIMS stems from the fact that there are still undiagnosed conditions children are born into. Five-year old Ameya was taken to Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology where she was prescribed two scans, first for treatment and another to see its impact. On December 27, 2021 with severe vomiting, Ameya was admitted to District Hospital in Kanhangad, but the doctors were clueless, said Fareena Kottappuram a school teacher and general convener of the collective at a press meet held on February 3. Ameya was then shifted to the ICU as there was no time left to take her to another hospital, where she died.\n\nSignature campaign at protest site\nTwo years of COVID 19 has broken the health logistics that generations of endosulfan victims relied upon. The dependency on both private and government hospitals in neighbouring state Karnataka came to almost an end. The lack of a multispecialty hospital as recommended by the Supreme Court, pushed them to rely upon the next hospital in proximity, within Kerala. Several patients in need of physiotherapy were limited to their beds. Surgeries were either postponed or medicines continued and only painkillers were administered. When the national lockdown was imposed, the state government did not initiate any special rehabilitation project for the endosulfan victims. To make matters worse, their pensions were delayed. This led to another protest.\n\""There is no other district where people have died on the road gasping, because they did not get treatment. At this point we realised that we have nothing in terms of health infrastructure,\u201d says social activist Ambalathara Kunjikrishnan, who had been in the forefront of anti-endosulfan agitation. \u201cWe realised we need to have a research oriented medical facility to find out the problems these children are facing, which is why we demand AIIMS. Three children who died recently belong to Scheduled Caste communities,\u201d Kunjikrishnan notes. In 2014, five MLAs filed a petition with the Oommen Chandy government demanding to add Kasargod to the proposed list for AIIMS. But the government included Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. In 2017 an all party committee met the chief minister, but were told that only Calicut would be considered. \u201cKasargod is the most backward district in the state. Interior villages like Bayar, Panathur etc. are denied better medical care and people of these villages have joined this protest\u201d Zubair, a People\u2019s Democratic Party leader said.\n\n\tThe right to health\n\u201cIt was Kasargod district that was selected for a large scale cashew production as cashew factories were mushrooming in Kollam district. Cashew trees were extensively planted in both inhabited areas and isolated regions alike and the pesticide use was the easiest way for the state to ramp up cashew production.\nThis aerial strike has polluted rivers, rivulets, streams, ponds and wells. People who consumed water from these died early of cancerous diseases. It breaks our heart to see the new born babies who are born with diseases. Even after two to three decades, children with endosulfan-caused diseases are born, they die.&nbsp; Isn\u2019t it the government's responsibility to solve this issue permanently? An ordinary medical college that isn\u2019t functional yet is no solution. It is not mercy. For the district, it is a right to have AIIMS, an independent institute where the most modern, free treatments are available,\u201d a pamphlet distributed at the AIIMS People\u2019s Collective reads.\nSumathi, mother of eleven-year old Mithun who is living with six severe conditions, says that there are several cases that go unreported. She belongs to Mavilan, a Scheduled Tribe community. In October 2021, during an interview she told that she feels her pain is less while thinking about mothers who have three to four children who are endosulfan infected.\nMithun has been diagnosed with microcephaly, mixed cerebral palsy, global developmental delay, organic acidemia, grade IV PEM Marasmus, and severe hearing loss. He was not able to sleep till he was four years old. It was only after he started getting physiotherapy that he began to sleep. Sumathi opined the political parties are not unified for the cause due to health infrastructure. \u201cThere are many who aren\u2019t included in the list. We were assured that the list will be updated. It looks like the government does not want to accept the fact that many children are affected. If the district collector (Dr Sajith Babu) made a report saying that people who aren\u2019t endosulfan affected are included in the list, it is the fault of the process itself. It takes a lot of process to be on the list, doctors and experts are included\u201d Sumathi said.\n\n\tNeutralising the endosulfan stock\nKunjikrshnan says that endosulfan is just a representative of pesticide companies. Post the pesticide tragedy and ban, Kasaragod district was declared as bio district. \u201cThe companies are afraid that the district will reach a phase that says an absolute no to the pesticides. The district collector Dr Sajith Babu gave an interview that endosulfan can be consumed like water and he said nothing happened because of the pesticide. The collector said there are non deserving individuals in the list. He claims that there are cases in which diseases are cured. He is an agriculturalist and cannot claim to be an expert about diseases. He was aiming to find individuals whose medical conditions are cured, to claim that the rest are invalid. There is a conspiracy behind this to bring back the pesticide\u201d he stated. When asked about the remaining endosulfan stock that is still in the district, he said, \u201cThe endosulfan stock is kept in Plantation Corporation\u2019s three godowns at Periya, Cheemeni and Rajapuram since the pesticide was banned in 2000. In 2012, the barrels broke and there was a leakage in the Cheemeni warehouse. We demanded that it be neutralised. Around 1,600 litres of endosulfan had an expiry date in 2017. The then district collector Jithendran had assured us that this will be shifted to new barrels. But five years have passed. We demanded the pesticide be taken back to the company and the neutralisation done in a scientific manner. But in 2021 October they made a move to secretly bury the pesticide in a pit, spending Rs 43 lakhs. We protested again. The present collector is aware of things and assured that they would conduct studies. The people of Kasargod can\u2019t stand another experiment.\u201d\n\n\tCan we say Kerala Number One?\nDr YS Mohan Kumar, while working in Swarga village, found out that there was an increase in diseases in the 1990s and realised the dangers of endosulfan. While working as a doctor, he published research findings about this in medical journals. Speaking of the present conditions in Kasargod\u2019s health infrastructure, he says that Kerala being number one model is an unreal claim.\n\u201cA new medical college is being built at Ukkinadka. It has been four years since construction began and no attempt is being made to speed up the work. The service of good specialists and doctors must be made useful here. Without developing the infrastructure can we say Kerala is Number one?\u201d Dr Mohan Kumar asked.\n\u201cKerala model is a media propaganda. Rural health infrastructure must be developed, urban dwellers are not the only ones who deserve health facilities. I stay forty kilometres interior from the main road. We don\u2019t have a good road. Last year, a child who got an electric shock died without getting any medical aid. In the hilly areas of Kasargod\u2019s interior, we only have primary health centres. We have one in Badiadka. It is not functioning full time. In Karnataka, there are CHCs that function round the clock. In number one Kerala the service is available only till 2 pm. Where should we go after 2 pm?\u201d he questioned.\nMuneesa, who has visual disability and gynaecological issues due to endosulfan, is a front leader running a rehabilitation centre named \u2018Sneha Veedu\u2019 for children with disabilities.\n\u201cFor a majority of people, going to the hospital is a huge task. Going to Trivandrum and returning takes twenty six hours for us by train. They make us run from hospital to hospital. If the government has the will to facilitate our demands it wouldn\u2019t take much of a time. Each life is valuable. For the mother, the child is as important with or without disabilities. Doctors are frustrated because they do not have enough facilities to treat us. The TATA sponsored COVID hospital was built in three months. Why is there a delay of ten years in the medical college construction?\u201d Muneesa asks.\nIn 2016, Thiruvananthapuram based NGO Satya Sai Trust proposed a two hundred bed specialty hospital in Kasargod. The project was launched in 2018. The trust has also built 45 houses in five acres of land in Eriya near Periya, but the allocation of these houses to the beneficiary families are yet to be fulfilled. The procedure has to be done through the Special Cell for Rehabilitation of endosulfan victims, which has not met for more than a&nbsp; year.\nMuneesa thinks that the Kerala legislative assembly\u2019s recent decision to appoint two more neurologists in Kasargod district is a result of the ongoing protest for AIIMS. She keeps receiving calls from mothers of endosulfan affected children when there is a medical emergency. A mother couldn\u2019t find a facility even in Kannur for an MRI scan for her son and had to contact a hospital in Mangaluru, but it could be done only with an RT PCR test result. \u201cIt requires staying there for a day and getting the tests done. The parents are not financially well off to do it.&nbsp; After I discussed it in a state committee group for welfare, a person arranged the facility at a hospital in Kannur. But this is just for a child. How long and how many children can survive like this? A Supreme Court verdict exists that says medical facilities should be facilitated by the state government\u201d she said.\n\nThe Kasargod Government medical college under construction\nKasargod medical college now has a neurosurgeon who is available thrice a week. \u201cNow facilities are available for the endosulfan affected community in the medical college like seizure management, epilepsy, and treatment for infections. The medical college is functioning as a temporary outpatient department. Rest of the facilities will be hopefully brought in near future,\u201d Dr Adarsh, medical superintendent of Kasargod Government medical college told TNM. Construction work on the hospital had been halted again due to non-payment of wages to workers and resumed only after an assurance of payment was given.\nThe author is a freelance journalist based in Kerala.

In the few minutes of an interview that he could spare on a Wednesday, Jeo mentions \u201ccontent\u201d half a dozen times. When, during the pandemic, it was too hard to make a full-length film, and he thought of an anthology for which he looked for \u201ccontent\u201d. The anthology that\u2019s come out is Freedom Fight, but Jeo had not asked filmmakers to make their content about freedom per se. It\u2019s just a happy coincidence that all of them, including Jeo, wrote scripts which had the underlying message of freedom and the fight for it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what a person needs more than anything else \u2013 freedom,\u201d Jeo says, during the interview. It is not always something you be conscious of, but you might just have a part in curbing another\u2019s freedom. Jeo thought of his father when he made Old Age Home, his film in the anthology. It\u2019s about an old man having memory issues, who walks around dazed and disoriented, and has a special craving for sweets he cannot have on account of his health..\n\u201cI used to hide sweets from my father because he was diabetic. I have scolded him when he was supposed to take a walk but instead hitched a ride home,\u201d Jeo says, sounding guilty of his past actions. You can see Jeo\u2019s experiences reflected in how he got Joju George to play the old man so beautifully. What makes Joju marvelous is that he seemingly does not find it at all hard to step into the shoes of a man several decades older than him. He reveals the adorable side of old age, when men sound like children and ask permission for everything. \u201cCan I have a laddu?\u201d he asks pleadingly to the new domestic worker in the film, played by actor Rohini.\nRohini, proving more and more with every new film what a talented performer she is, laughs like a friend, seeing the old man\u2019s dilemma. In one scene, he keeps pestering her about going to the temple, and she turns to look at him, breaks into laughter, and asks, \u201cWhat do you want now, sir? The payasam in the temple?\u201d\nRead: Freedom Fight review: Jeo Baby\u2019s anthology is enjoyable, makes you think\n\n\tJeo with Rohini and Joju\nJeo builds a beautiful camaraderie between the two characters. That too comes from his own life experiences, when his mother-in-law had moved in with them and began a friendship with his father. \u201cIt is my wife Beena who found this out. My mother-in-law would let my father have an occasional sweet or some sugar in his tea. She said it would do no one any worse if he had something he liked once in a while. My father also liked to talk a lot \u2013 like Joju in the movie. But all of us in the family were like strict hostel wardens to him, he didn\u2019t have company,\u201d Jeo says.\nJoju knew about Jeo\u2019s father\u2019s situation, he says. During the filming of his earlier movie Kunjudaivam, Jeo had spoken to Joju about it and about the idea he had to make a film. \u201cAlso, I have always wanted to work with Rohini chechi, because she is such a wonderful performer. And Lali joined the film because she looks like my mother in appearance,\u201d Jeo says.\nLali PM plays the partner to Joju\u2019s old man character as Baby, a woman who takes an interest in making snacks with jackfruit and running a business in her old age. She tells her complaining children that it is only now that she is finally getting to do what she wants, and she is not going to stop. There, behind the main story, we glimpse another freedom sought by many women, who keep aside for their youth to raise children.\n\u201cThat part comes from my mother\u2019s life. I have used even the same lines she speaks, running her jackfruit business,\u201d Jeo admits.\nThe whole film is, in that way, lifted largely from his life. But so are most of the other films in the anthology.\n\n\tJithin, Francies, Kunjila, Akhil and Jeo\nKunjila Mascillamani, who made Asanghadithar (The Unorganised) in the Freedom Fight, tells the story of Penkoottu, the real life fight of a group of women to bring toilets to the street they worked in. Ration, directed by Jeo\u2019s editor Francies Louis in the anthology, is also based on a real life story. In that one, Jeo acts as a disgruntled man who is no help to his wife when she gets into trouble after cooking their neighbour\u2019s fish.&nbsp;\n\u201cI enjoy acting, especially such characters. Since I knew Francies, I made a few suggestions as well. But I haven\u2019t interfered in the creative process of any other films. I didn\u2019t even know any of them, and found them, when I was searching for films with good content,\u201d Jeo says.\nJithin Issac Thomas joined the team after Jeo happened to watch his feature film, Attention Please, and liked it. His film in the anthology, Pra. Thoo. Mu., talks about the plight of septic tank cleaners. Kunjila came onboard after Salu, Jeo\u2019s Director of Photography, told him about her. Both Salu and Kunjila were students of the Satyajit Ray Film &amp; Television Institute. The fifth filmmaker, Akhil Anilkumar, who made the short about a woman\u2019s freedom in choosing her partner, Geethu Unchained, had called Jeo to ask about an online platform for his short film, and Jeo liked the story. In all these cases, Jeo only looked at the content of the work.\nWatch: Trailer of Freedom Fight\n\nIn his own film, he knew he wanted to say a story that was entirely different from the hugely successful The Great Indian Kitchen. He couldn\u2019t repeat himself as a filmmaker. He\u2019d made his statement, made clear his politics on the subject. And he got to know the impact truly well. So many women contacted him, Jeo says, and still do. He can\u2019t say one message was more striking than another. \u201cOne woman said she\u2019d been feeling guilty about separating from her husband and felt better after the movie. Another said she stepped out of a house of abuse after the movie. A third said the film made her like herself better. Even a few men wrote to me to say they understand the lives of their wives and mothers a lot better,\u201d Jeo says.\nHe hopes that Old Age Home too will initiate conversations, on the plight of old people and the restricted lives they lead.&nbsp;\nThe film began streaming on SonyLIV on Friday, February 11.\nRead: 'The Great Indian Kitchen': Women have only their chains to lose and nothing else\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/kerala-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Interview</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Jeo Baby brought together five filmmakers (including himself) to make films with good content; and coincidentally, they all had the underlying message of freedom.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/cris\"">Cris</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/JeoBaby_FB_120222_1200-compressed.jpg\""><img alt=\""Jeo Baby with beard\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/JeoBaby_FB_120222_1200-compressed.jpg?itok=twEd0EyR\"" title=\""Jeo Baby with salt and pepper beard wearing a grey t shirt and standing against greenery\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Content matters a lot to Jeo Baby, the man who directed The Great Indian Kitchen, a film that got people talking about women\u2019s labour in the house.

But so are most of the other films in the anthology.\n\n\tJithin, Francies, Kunjila, Akhil and Jeo\nKunjila Mascillamani, who made Asanghadithar (The Unorganised) in the Freedom Fight, tells the story of Penkoottu, the real life fight of a group of women to bring toilets to the street they worked in. Ration, directed by Jeo\u2019s editor Francies Louis in the anthology, is also based on a real life story. In that one, Jeo acts as a disgruntled man who is no help to his wife when she gets into trouble after cooking their neighbour\u2019s fish.&nbsp;\n\u201cI enjoy acting, especially such characters. Since I knew Francies, I made a few suggestions as well. But I haven\u2019t interfered in the creative process of any other films. I didn\u2019t even know any of them, and found them, when I was searching for films with good content,\u201d Jeo says.\nJithin Issac Thomas joined the team after Jeo happened to watch his feature film, Attention Please, and liked it. His film in the anthology, Pra. Thoo. Mu., talks about the plight of septic tank cleaners. Kunjila came onboard after Salu, Jeo\u2019s Director of Photography, told him about her. Both Salu and Kunjila were students of the Satyajit Ray Film &amp; Television Institute. The fifth filmmaker, Akhil Anilkumar, who made the short about a woman\u2019s freedom in choosing her partner, Geethu Unchained, had called Jeo to ask about an online platform for his short film, and Jeo liked the story. In all these cases, Jeo only looked at the content of the work.\nWatch: Trailer of Freedom Fight\n\nIn his own film, he knew he wanted to say a story that was entirely different from the hugely successful The Great Indian Kitchen. He couldn\u2019t repeat himself as a filmmaker. He\u2019d made his statement, made clear his politics on the subject. And he got to know the impact truly well. So many women contacted him, Jeo says, and still do. He can\u2019t say one message was more striking than another. \u201cOne woman said she\u2019d been feeling guilty about separating from her husband and felt better after the movie. Another said she stepped out of a house of abuse after the movie. A third said the film made her like herself better. Even a few men wrote to me to say they understand the lives of their wives and mothers a lot better,\u201d Jeo says.\nHe hopes that Old Age Home too will initiate conversations, on the plight of old people and the restricted lives they lead.&nbsp;\nThe film began streaming on SonyLIV on Friday, February 11.\nRead: 'The Great Indian Kitchen': Women have only their chains to lose and nothing else\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 09:11:10 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 12, 9, 11, 10, 5, 43, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Cris""}], ""author"": ""Cris"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Cris""}, ""id"": ""160899 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hope-freedom-fight-starts-discussions-way-great-indian-kitchen-did-jeo-baby-160899#comments""}, {""title"": ""Kerala youth Babu\u2019s dramatic rescue sheds light on dangers of unsafe adventure tourism"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/kerala-feeds"", ""value"": ""Kerala youth Babu\u2019s dramatic rescue sheds light on dangers of unsafe adventure tourism""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-youth-babu-s-dramatic-rescue-sheds-light-dangers-unsafe-adventure-tourism-160898""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-youth-babu-s-dramatic-rescue-sheds-light-dangers-unsafe-adventure-tourism-160898"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Tourism</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Illegal adventure tourism in the forests of Kerala is on the rise since the advent of social media, with more people preferring to travel through the unexplored wilderness without proper preparation.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/anjana-george\"">Anjana George</a></div><div class=\""field-item odd\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/sandeep-vellaram\"">Sandeep Vellaram</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/BabuPalakkadhill_080222_1200_2.jpg\""><img alt=\""R Babu, trapped in Kurumbachi hills in Malampuzha\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/BabuPalakkadhill_080222_1200_2.jpg?itok=Mp-MqAWK\"" title=\""R Babu, trapped in Kurumbachi hills in Malampuzha\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">R Babu, trapped in Kurumbachi hills in Malampuzha</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The Palakkad youth R Babu, who was rescued by the Indian Army on Wednesday, February 9, after being trapped in a crevice in 1000-feet-high Kurumbachi hills in Malampuzha for more than 43 hours, has been discharged from Palakkad District Hospital after treatment. The 23-year-old slipped and fell into a deep gorge, which is around 200 feet lower than the summit, on Monday, while descending from the mountain with his two friends. After failed rescue attempts, his friends reached the base of the hill and informed authorities. While the rescue operations were through, he survived on the hill side between rocks in the scorching heat with no water or food for more than a day.&nbsp;The government had to take the Indian Army's help after land and air rescue failed.\nMeanwhile, the lack of proper adventure tourism practices or guidelines in Kerala has resulted in other incidents such as the one in Malampuzha too. While trekking last week, a youth fell down to the gorge near Munnar in Kerala. On January 30, a 25-year-old tourist lost his life after falling from a 600-feet-high gorge near the Karadippara view point in Munnar, Idukki. According to the officials of Vellathooval police station, the 17-member team which he was part of trekked through a no-go zone. In the beginning of 2021, a 26-year-old died in a wild elephant attack at Wayanad while she was staying in a tent provided by a private resort, in Meppadi forest range. The resort was forcefully closed by the Meppadi gram panchayat officials when they found out that it had been functioning without any licences.\nAdventure tourism experts and Forest Department officials pointed out that such activities do not account for responsible adventure tourism.\n\n\tIllegal adventure tourism on the rise in Kerala\nIllegal adventure tourism in the forests of Kerala is on the rise since the advent of social media. There is also an increase in the number of explorers and trekkers who prefer to travel through the unexplored wilderness. According to travel enthusiasts, the beauty of adventure tourism was to reconnect with nature, disconnecting from daily life. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries had developed a physiological and psychological exercise named Shinrin-Yoku (forest bathing) in 1982. The widely practiced nature therapy explores how spending time in the wilderness reduces the stress hormone cortisol and boosts the immune system. Unfortunately, people are now focused more on the pictures than the experience and as a result more selfie related deaths are being reported as well, say experts.\n\""Anything and everything is an experience on social media. For many, traveling is all about clicking selfies and obsession over likes. Social media made the Kurumbalakotta hillock in Wayanad a dream destination. The site is now facing the ill effects of over-tourism and waste management issues are causing harm to the ecosystem. Young tourists, out of over enthusiasm, land in life threatening situations. Tourists being harmed or stranded while trekking or in the forest has become a common news for us. Many are injured and have even died during such unprepared and unsafe trips. I had recently encountered two incidents in Kallar and Kuttampuzha. Babu survived mainly due to the media attention he received. Those who fantasise about these places are unaware of the risks involved in it,\"" says tourism researcher and practitioner Sumesh Mangalasserry.\nIn the wake of the Malampuzha incident, Idukki District Collector Sheeba George banned all illegal trekking in Idukki district. \""Illegal off-road trekking and high mountain trekking in the district were banned under Disaster Management Authority Act 2005 from February 11 onwards,\"" Sheeba said.\nMeanwhile, the Forest Department has strengthened the surveillance since the 2018 Kurangini forest fire tragedy where 23 out of 36 trekkers were killed when they took the Kurangani route to Kolukkumalai for trekking which was not authorised or approved by the Forest Department. Though the Department is trying hard to clamp down on unauthorised trekkers and agencies who does not have any awareness, preparation or training, Muhammed Anwar, Deputy Director, Forest Training Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, reveals that a few still manage to trespass into the forest in the name of adventure.\n\""The youngsters are not interested in taking up the routes that are being traversed commonly. They think it is adventurous to post pictures on social media travelling to unknown spots \u2013 exploring the unexplored. However, it is important to ensure safety and follow law when you set out for adventure. Majority has no clue that entering even in the reserve forest area is a punishable offense,\"" he says.\nMuhammed further explains that forest is an unpredictable space and night time in the forest is more dangerous than the day time. \""Many trained experts who are very used to the forest routes have hopelessly lost their way in the forest [in the night]. Only luck can save those who get stuck there. Animals have a movement pattern and they usually do not prefer to cross the area where human presence is there. When someone intrudes in a core or deep interior forest areas, it will be observed by the animals. If you are alone, then survival would be really difficult as we are not even equipped to defend an animal attack. Do not venture into these gimmicks for a few likes, subscriptions and shares on social media,\"" he says.\nS Guruvayurappan, South Indian coordinator of The Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), remembers traveling with a tour group to know the precautions and preparations the team undertakes during for trekking.&nbsp;\""I went with them to confirm and learnt that if we try to inform or educate them, they will boycott us. There are many [treks] like these which sounds beautiful and magical. None of [the organisers] have a licence and they are just groups of a few 'travel buffs'. They will be granted unofficial permission from the local officials there. We need stricter laws,\"" said Guruvayoorappan.\n\n\tSetting up safe adventure tourism\nThe charming highland areas of Western Ghats, stunning waterfalls, deep dark forests, tranquil rivers, crystalline backwaters and palm-lined beaches in Kerala offer abundant scope for adventure tourism.&nbsp;Hadlee Renjith, a licensed adventure tourism operator in Munnar shares that Malampuzha-like incidents will adversely affect those who rely on adventure tourism for employment. \""As trekking involves a bit of adventure, accidents might happen and the immediate measure taken by the government is to ban all the activities in that area,\"" he says.\nRather than taking extreme steps like imposing bans or closing down the routes, Sumesh suggests the government come up with a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework that speaks both for humans and the environment. \""Considering the possible economic development, Kerala should explore the potential of adventure tourism in the state. We need to think beyond the guidelines issued by the Department of Tourism on adventure tourism, which is a welcoming move,\"" he says.\nRemembering the trekking experiences naturalist and photographer Sebinster Francis from Munnar had during his visit to Indonesia and Kenya, he says Keralites are used to unauthorised trekking, which is termed as an adventure. \""Most of the people indulge [in unsafe activities] due to mere ignorance. In Indonesia and Kenya, I saw boards being placed to identify proper trekking routes. There were guided routes and non-guided routes. They have also fixed boards in trekking restricted areas and rules are stringent, hence the tourists dare not trespass,\"" he says.\nThe three must-haves for adventure tourism, in Sumesh's view, are a plan for visitor management, involvement of locals and the presence of trained safety and rescue experts. Muhammed recommends the adventure tourism packages guided and permitted by the Kerala Tourism Department and the Forest Department to the adventure lovers. \""We have trained and oriented watchers assigned to accompany the tourists who can ensure the safety and welfare of the tourists.

Preparing 'pongala' is considered an auspicious ritual of the annual festival of the Attukal Bhagavathy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.\nLast year also the Pongala festival was held without the mass gathering of women devotees in public places and long lines of wayside makeshift hearths.\nWith active COVID-19 cases in Kerala starting to show a decline over the past few days, the Kerala government had earlier decided to ease COVID-19 restrictions and asked schools and colleges in the state to prepare for functioning in a full-fledged manner from the end of February.&nbsp;\nDaily COVID-19 cases in Kerala continued to drop below 20,000 with the state on Friday recording 16,012 fresh infections which raised the total caseload to 63,81,063.\nThe southern state had reported 18,420 COVID-19 cases on Thursday.\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 04:40:10 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 12, 4, 40, 10, 5, 43, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""LukeKoshi""}], ""author"": ""LukeKoshi"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""LukeKoshi""}, ""id"": ""160892 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-govt-decides-allow-1500-people-major-religious-festivals-160892#comments""}, {""title"": ""New dates announced for Kerala Film Festival"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/kerala-feeds"", ""value"": ""New dates announced for Kerala Film Festival""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/new-dates-announced-kerala-film-festival-160889""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/new-dates-announced-kerala-film-festival-160889"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Films</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Over 180 films will be screened across 14 movie theatres in Thiruvananthapuram.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/tnm-staff\"">TNM Staff</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/IFFK_25th_110222_1200-compressed.jpg\""><img alt=\""Delegates get temperature checked by a volunteer in green jacket outside a theatre\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/IFFK_25th_110222_1200-compressed.jpg?itok=9-ZqKHbD\"" title=\""IFFK in 2021\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">From IFFK in 2021</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The 26th edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), which was earlier postponed due to an increase in COVID-19 cases, will be held in March 2022.

All this, however, didn\u2019t prevent the Education Department from sending him a memo for writing an article that was critical of question papers.\nPremachandran is a Malayalam teacher at the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Payyanur in Kannur district. He wrote an article about the question&nbsp;papers for the final exams for Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC), Higher Secondary and Vocational Higher Secondary.

This made them earn high scores. But the exam papers this year have been prepared by changing the Focus Area, because of which the students need to study the syllabus for each subject for the whole academic year in 20-25 hours.\n\u201cFor both SSLC&nbsp;and Class 12 students, it usually takes 200 days to finish the syllabus. The schools in the state, which were closed due to the pandemic, reopened&nbsp;on November 1. That too, only half the students were allowed (on alternative days) till noon.

This has been reduced to 50% this year,\u201d it reads.\nHe alleged foul play in the same. \u201cThose who prepared the questions papers have done it in understanding with the Central Board of Secondary Education so that CBSE students would get higher scores while state syllabus students would get only B grade.

There are thirty markings on it, reasons for every bombed proposal captioned with cricketing terms \u2013 run out, wide, match fixing, third umpire and so on. It\u2019s almost a mechanical process, something she has to get finished before hurriedly wrapping a saree around her and running after a bus to go to work. Archana 31 Not Out begins by setting the scene of this very ordinary life of a woman in her late 20s, getting prepared for an arranged marriage, working at a school and making ends meet. The smooth beginning, however, goes down a slippery slope, as the movie, in its rush to pass on a delectable message, forgets the path it set.\nAishwarya Lekshmi is almost unrecognisable in this role. Curly haired and sari-wearing, pulling herself away from the earlier modern young woman characters, and fitting herself comfortably into this role of a village teacher, leading an all too practical life. For the first several minutes she does not even smile but passes through the daily motions like a robot, a frown forming on her face every morning. It is only when a folksy song opens on the screen that there is some joy, some exchanges between her and the students, some camaraderie between teachers.\nThe songs are mostly calming that way (music by Maathan and Rajat Prakash). The title song cleverly tells the story of Archana growing up, loving cricket. It explains her calendar markings but you don\u2019t really get how cricket comes into her adult life, except as nostalgic recollections and a frequently falling old trophy. It is to be understood that she left behind the game when the responsibility of running the house fell on her shoulders. The father is aged and unwell, the mother apparently little concerned about what\u2019s going on, except to gossip with neighbours.\nWatch: Trailer of the film\n\nArchana seems detached from them all, though she has a soft spot for the nice and affectionate father. In her role as the breadwinner of the family, she has also taken the matter of her marriage into her hands, dealing directly with a broker (Rajesh Madhavan), arranging visits of prospective grooms, like a parent would. Even when she agrees to a marriage proposal it doesn\u2019t seem to come out of love, but convenience.\nAll through the first half of the film, you get reruns of Archana\u2019s days handling proposals and schoolwork and the many kinds of neighbours around her. It is enjoyable to watch different village lives, two sparring women and half a dozen old drunkards among them.

There are thirty markings on it, reasons for every bombed proposal captioned with cricketing terms \u2013 run out, wide, match fixing, third umpire and so on. It\u2019s almost a mechanical process, something she has to get finished before hurriedly wrapping a saree around her and running after a bus to go to work. Archana 31 Not Out begins by setting the scene of this very ordinary life of a woman in her late 20s, getting prepared for an arranged marriage, working at a school and making ends meet. The smooth beginning, however, goes down a slippery slope, as the movie, in its rush to pass on a delectable message, forgets the path it set.\nAishwarya Lekshmi is almost unrecognisable in this role. Curly haired and sari-wearing, pulling herself away from the earlier modern young woman characters, and fitting herself comfortably into this role of a village teacher, leading an all too practical life. For the first several minutes she does not even smile but passes through the daily motions like a robot, a frown forming on her face every morning. It is only when a folksy song opens on the screen that there is some joy, some exchanges between her and the students, some camaraderie between teachers.\nThe songs are mostly calming that way (music by Maathan and Rajat Prakash). The title song cleverly tells the story of Archana growing up, loving cricket. It explains her calendar markings but you don\u2019t really get how cricket comes into her adult life, except as nostalgic recollections and a frequently falling old trophy. It is to be understood that she left behind the game when the responsibility of running the house fell on her shoulders. The father is aged and unwell, the mother apparently little concerned about what\u2019s going on, except to gossip with neighbours.\nWatch: Trailer of the film\n\nArchana seems detached from them all, though she has a soft spot for the nice and affectionate father. In her role as the breadwinner of the family, she has also taken the matter of her marriage into her hands, dealing directly with a broker (Rajesh Madhavan), arranging visits of prospective grooms, like a parent would. Even when she agrees to a marriage proposal it doesn\u2019t seem to come out of love, but convenience.\nAll through the first half of the film, you get reruns of Archana\u2019s days handling proposals and schoolwork and the many kinds of neighbours around her. It is enjoyable to watch different village lives, two sparring women and half a dozen old drunkards among them. They are all wonderful actors, who unfortunately seem like props arranged on a big stage, playing their part on cue, rather than fitting into the natural setting of the film.\nThe movie does manage to build suspense, introducing the character of Indrans as a strange old man loitering around Archana\u2019s house; and planting midway a phone call that disrupts everything.

Will just some of the short films work, or will all of them, you wonder. In the case of Freedom Fight, a Malayalam anthology put together by Jeo Baby, all of them do. Five films, each unique, tell straightforward stories, sprinkled with a little humour and a lot of emotion. They are enjoyable and they make you think.\nOne woman realises what a big mistake it will be if she went ahead and married her boyfriend of two years and backs out of it. Another woman gathers around females working in shops on a street in Kozhikode to raise the problem of toilet shortage. A third runs from pillar to post to replace the expensive fish belonging to her neighbour, after accidentally cooking it. A fourth sympathises with an old man who is fast losing his memory and yearns for sweets. A fifth watches in silence as a septic tank cleaner walks into her house leaving dirty footprints.\nIn order, these short films have been made by Akhil Anilkumar, Kunjila Mascillamani, Francies Louis, Jeo Baby and Jithin Issac Thomas. The films broadly fall under the theme of freedom.\nRajisha Vijayan, who has mastered the art of letting a story revolve around a female protagonist, becomes the woman who breaks off an engagement, and is forced to feel the shame it\u2019s brought the family in Geethu Unchained. Rajisha as Geethu, lets her family and her workmates treat her poorly for her choices, while telling her side of the story to random strangers. Akhil Anilkumar keeps using this adorable tool to quickly let the viewer catch up with what\u2019s been going on. Geethu appears to be on a guilt trip, uncomplainingly accepting all the new rules for her, but it is no sad story. Except for the abrupt ending and the trying-to-be-cute beginning, it is a humourous half an hour.\nKunjila\u2019s segment plunges straight into the heart of the story \u2013 a bunch of women climbing gates in the night to build a toilet. It is a familiar story \u2013 the real life fight led by Viji, a tailor turned activist, to get toilet facilities for women working in a Kozhikode street. Titled Asanghadithar (The Unorganised), the film does not attempt to paint pictures of overly brave women spitting out lengthy words against their unjust employers. It simply points the camera at the very real lives of a few women, suffering without a toilet to use amid 10 to 12 hours of work. Srindaa is just wonderful in the film, you\u2019d want to adopt her and take her home. She is sweet, innocent, speaks her mind, gets tongue-tied, shows her fear and never backs down. Simply because that is not an option for these women. Viji plays herself in the movie and smoothly fits into the plot, even adding to the humour that the film is rich with.\nWatch: Trailer of Freedom Fight\n\nIn the third segment, Jeo Baby appears out of nowhere, handing out ration in a shop. It is not the one he\u2019s directed but it\u2019s just as good. Francies Louis, who was Jeo\u2019s editor, directs the film titled Ration, effortlessly showing the stark difference between the rich and the poor without obvious enunciations. There are two neighbours, one so rich there isn\u2019t enough space in her spacious fridge to hold all the ingredients for the night\u2019s dinner, and the other poor enough to not have Rs 2,000 with her on a wretched afternoon. Kabani, playing Jeo\u2019s wife, steals the show. She plays the average homemaker, shouting at the child keeping the house running, and having friendly conversations with the rich neighbour. Things go awry when the wrong fish is cooked and the rest of the film is full of visuals telling you the story \u2013 hands moving over a number of dishes laid out on a table, a ring, legs of men drinking together, and disturbed sleep. It\u2019s short and beautiful.\nJeo Baby, presenter of the whole show, changes tack with his segment Old Age Home. He had addressed the basic problem of women\u2019s freedom more than well in The Great Indian Kitchen. This time, he has chosen to tell an old man\u2019s tale, played remarkably well by Joju George. Only, even with the makeup and the greying hair, his face gives away that he is not old enough to be the pensioner he plays. But Joju lets you forget all of it as he moves in slow steps, wearing a pair of shoes and tying up his mundu, asking around for more laddus and gilebis. He is suffering memory loss, speaks slowly, but still holds onto his sense of right and wrong. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you let Dhanu go to temple,\u201d he asks his wife when he thinks it was a wrong act. Dhanu is played by Rohini, so easily fitting into the role of a sensitive domestic worker. The easy camaraderie between the two is a treat to watch.\nFinally, Jithin\u2019s segment Pra. Thoo. Mu., one of the shortest of the lot, shows the everyday plight of septic tank cleaners by narrating a single day\u2019s incident. Lakshmanan, one of the workers cleaning the tank of a wealthy minister\u2019s house, loses his temper when a toilet is flushed and the dirty water gets sprayed on him. What happens afterward is where the story begins. The film is in black and white, perhaps to mark the difference between the classes of people, or else to hide the colours of human waste. But it draws attention to Lakshmanan\u2019s story. Sidhartha Siva and Unni Lalu play the main roles. The film with a powerful message though falls short due to lack of conviction.\nThe film is streaming on SonyLIV.\nDisclaimer: This review was not paid for or commissioned by anyone associated with the film.

There are two neighbours, one so rich there isn\u2019t enough space in her spacious fridge to hold all the ingredients for the night\u2019s dinner, and the other poor enough to not have Rs 2,000 with her on a wretched afternoon. Kabani, playing Jeo\u2019s wife, steals the show. She plays the average homemaker, shouting at the child keeping the house running, and having friendly conversations with the rich neighbour. Things go awry when the wrong fish is cooked and the rest of the film is full of visuals telling you the story \u2013 hands moving over a number of dishes laid out on a table, a ring, legs of men drinking together, and disturbed sleep. It\u2019s short and beautiful.\nJeo Baby, presenter of the whole show, changes tack with his segment Old Age Home. He had addressed the basic problem of women\u2019s freedom more than well in The Great Indian Kitchen. This time, he has chosen to tell an old man\u2019s tale, played remarkably well by Joju George. Only, even with the makeup and the greying hair, his face gives away that he is not old enough to be the pensioner he plays. But Joju lets you forget all of it as he moves in slow steps, wearing a pair of shoes and tying up his mundu, asking around for more laddus and gilebis. He is suffering memory loss, speaks slowly, but still holds onto his sense of right and wrong. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you let Dhanu go to temple,\u201d he asks his wife when he thinks it was a wrong act. Dhanu is played by Rohini, so easily fitting into the role of a sensitive domestic worker. The easy camaraderie between the two is a treat to watch.\nFinally, Jithin\u2019s segment Pra. Thoo. Mu., one of the shortest of the lot, shows the everyday plight of septic tank cleaners by narrating a single day\u2019s incident. Lakshmanan, one of the workers cleaning the tank of a wealthy minister\u2019s house, loses his temper when a toilet is flushed and the dirty water gets sprayed on him. What happens afterward is where the story begins. The film is in black and white, perhaps to mark the difference between the classes of people, or else to hide the colours of human waste. But it draws attention to Lakshmanan\u2019s story. Sidhartha Siva and Unni Lalu play the main roles. The film with a powerful message though falls short due to lack of conviction.\nThe film is streaming on SonyLIV.\nDisclaimer: This review was not paid for or commissioned by anyone associated with the film.

It\u2019s essentially a supposedly \u2018thrilling\u2019 take on how Indian Muslims, good or bad, are damned either way. In the film, the National Investigative Agency (NIA) headed by Gautham Vasudev Menon is on the hunt for a faceless Islamic State operative in Chennai.

In the crescendo of racey music, you are likely to forget you are just being indoctrinated.&nbsp;\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 10:42:56 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 12, 10, 42, 56, 5, 43, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""AjayR""}], ""author"": ""AjayR"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""AjayR""}, ""id"": ""160902 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/fir-review-muslim-stereotypes-galore-vishnu-thriller-160902#comments""}, {""title"": ""Schools in three TN districts to be shut on Feb 12 as heavy rains predicted"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu-feeds"", ""value"": ""Schools in three TN districts to be shut on Feb 12 as heavy rains predicted""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/schools-three-tn-districts-be-shut-feb-12-heavy-rains-predicted-160894""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/schools-three-tn-districts-be-shut-feb-12-heavy-rains-predicted-160894"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Rains</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The IMD has warned of heavy rainfall at isolated places over south coastal Tamil Nadu during the weekend. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/tnm-staff\"">TNM Staff</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Rainfall_PTI_16072021_1200.jpg\""><img alt=\""People walking on the road with umbrellas\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Rainfall_PTI_16072021_1200.jpg?itok=YjNiPvaf\"" title=\""People walking on the road with umbrellas\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">pti /file image</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of heavy rainfall at isolated places over south coastal Tamil Nadu during the next two days.

The situation, according to police, has been brought under control but authorities added that SC/ST organisations were conducting sporadic protest marches near the area.\n(With IANS inputs)\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Fri, 11 Feb 2022 09:25:28 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 11, 9, 25, 28, 4, 42, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""AzeefaF""}], ""author"": ""AzeefaF"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""AzeefaF""}, ""id"": ""160871 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-man-dies-after-being-assaulted-dominant-caste-hindus-coimbatore-7-held-160871#comments""}, {""title"": ""Madras HC Acting CJ Munishwar Nath Bhandari appointed Chief Justice"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu-feeds"", ""value"": ""Madras HC Acting CJ Munishwar Nath Bhandari appointed Chief Justice""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/madras-hc-acting-cj-munishwar-nath-bhandari-appointed-chief-justice-160859""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/madras-hc-acting-cj-munishwar-nath-bhandari-appointed-chief-justice-160859"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Court</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Justice Bhandari had taken over as the acting chief justice of Madras HC following the transfer of Justice Sanjib Banerjee to the Meghalaya HC in November last year.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/pti\"">PTI</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/JusticeBhandari_RNRavi_MKStalin_1200_Twitter_11022022.jpg\""><img alt=\""Governor RN Ravi handing a bouquet to Justice Bhandari with MK Stalin standing next to RN Ravi\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/JusticeBhandari_RNRavi_MKStalin_1200_Twitter_11022022.jpg?itok=MYGvJO6S\"" title=\""MK Stalin, RN Ravi and Justice Bhandari\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">File photo</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, who had been appointed the Acting Chief Justice of the Madras High Court recently, has been made the Chief Justice of the High Court.

The BJP and right wing groups in Tamil Nadu took up the issue immediately after her death.\nHowever, despite Hindu groups in Tamil Nadu going hammer and tongs over the topic of religious conversions, in a small village in southern Tamil Nadu, eight Dalit families of 40 people voluntarily renounced Hinduism and converted to Islam. The mass conversion event happened in Dombucheri village in Bodinayakanur in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Theni district, in December 2021. The family members insist that they converted for a reason, i.e., to break free from caste oppression that they have been experiencing in the village since their birth.\n\nMen from Dombuchery offering Namaz in a room&nbsp;\nVeeralakshmi changed her name to Rahima after her conversion. The young mother pins her decision to convert on the dominant caste Thevars in Dombuchery, who violently attacked her husband, Mohammad Ismail, on November 4, 2021, the day of Deepavali.\n\nMohammad Ismail&nbsp;\n\u201cMy husband had taken our aunt to the neighbouring village to meet a doctor. On returning, he saw that a group of 30 men from the Thevar community were attacking his uncle Vairamuthu and four other cousins. When he intervened, he was hit on the head and had to be hospitalised for 10 days,\u201d Rahima says. As per Rahima\u2019s account, the Thevar men had asked her husband and his relatives how they could afford to buy cars and bikes, and then proceeded to vandalise the vehicles.\n\nBike vandalised on November 4\n\u201cThey took two of our cars and four bikes. They also hit six of us, out of which two of us \u2014 me and my uncle Vairamuthu \u2014 were badly injured and had to be hospitalised in the Kanavilakku Government Hospital in Theni,\u201d Mohammad Ismail tells TNM.\n\nOn November 4, four bikes and two cars belonging to the Arundhatiyar community\n\n\tPeriodic atrocities targeting Dalits\nIsmail adds that the above mentioned incident was not an isolated act of violence from the Thevar community. According to him, Thevar men would periodically visit the street where he and other Dalit families lived and target them. These men would start \u2018riots\u2019 and damage the houses and vehicles of the Dalit families, he says. \u201cThese men are jealous that we are able to buy cars and bikes. They ask how we Dalits are dressed so well and able to afford the vehicles?\u201d Ismail says.\nThe seeds of the November 4 violence were sown six months before it happened. According to Ismail, his uncle Palanichamy was attacked by a 22-year-old man, Alex, who belonged to the Thevar community. Alex, Ismail says, struck 38-year-old Palanichamy on the head with a knife. Badly injured, Palanichamy was immediately taken to a hospital in Theni, while Alex fled from the spot.\nAfter a police complaint, Alex was arrested and remanded to 15-days of judicial custody following which he was released. However, the arrest triggered resentment and anger within the Thevar community. Although seemingly calm, communal tensions were simmering in Dombuchery.\nFinally on November 4, Alex\u2019s brother gathered 30 Thevar men and entered the Dalit habitation. Arguments led to a violent clash which led to Ismail and Vairamuthu being badly injured.\n\nIsmail after being attacked on November 4\n\n\tCaste-based discrimination\nTamil Puligal party\u2019s North Theni secretary Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who was earlier known as Vairamuthu, says that ever since he remembers, dominant caste members of Dombuchery practised caste-based discrimination.\n\u201cDalit residents cannot get a hair cut inside the village,\u201d he says. The barber would only attend to Thevar men and the Dalit residents would have to go to neighbourhood villages to get hair cuts, he says. Similarly, if Dalit men visited the village tea shop, they could only sit on the floor and would be served in different tumblers, he explains. Rahima adds that Dalit men and women would be heckled if they walked to the bus stand, which was located close to the Thevar habitation. They would not be allowed to walk on the street or earlier and weren\u2019t allowed to wear slippers, she says.\nVairamuthu explains that the BJP, RSS and the Hindu Munnani party in the district were spinning a false propaganda of forced religious conversion and that the Dalit people were accepting money to convert. However, the reality, he says, is that there was no need to force or offer money. \u201cPeople volunteered to opt out of Hinduism and embrace a religion that would accept them,\u201d he says.\nThe eight families were the first batch, and more members from the 400-strong Dalit community in&nbsp;Dombuchery are expected to embrace Islam, according to him.\n\nMen from Dombuchery offering Namaz in a room&nbsp;\n\u201cThese Hindu organisations did not come to our aid when we were attacked and our homes and belongings were vandalised. But after hearing that we converted, they met us and requested us to reconvert. Why should we?\u201d Mohammad Ismail asks.\nIsmail cites denial of community acceptance and self respect as the major reasons for the eight Dalit families to convert to Islam \u201cWhen we were Hindus, the Thevar men addressed my grandfather and father by their names. They would not even respect my grandfather\u2019s age,\u201d he says. But Ismail insists that Islam has offered him and his community people equality, brotherhood, community acceptance, and most importantly self respect. The older Muslim members of the Theni mosque, which the eight families had visited in December, welcomed them with open arms, and offered them food and company, Ismail says.\nWith no mosque in Dombuchery, the eight families have been doing their namaaz or daily prayers in their houses. However, with more members converting to Islam, they hope to build a small mosque in the future.\nHowever, the families are unsure whether their conversion would help lessen caste-based targeting and attacks from the Thevars. \u201cIt has only been one month since we embraced Islam. We have to wait and watch how this will affect our dynamics with the Thevars,\u201d Ismail adds.\n\n\tLocal leaders stay neutral\nBoth the AIADMK and DMK have significant control over the wards in Dombucheri panchayat.

The BJP and right wing groups in Tamil Nadu took up the issue immediately after her death.\nHowever, despite Hindu groups in Tamil Nadu going hammer and tongs over the topic of religious conversions, in a small village in southern Tamil Nadu, eight Dalit families of 40 people voluntarily renounced Hinduism and converted to Islam. The mass conversion event happened in Dombucheri village in Bodinayakanur in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Theni district, in December 2021. The family members insist that they converted for a reason, i.e., to break free from caste oppression that they have been experiencing in the village since their birth.\n\nMen from Dombuchery offering Namaz in a room&nbsp;\nVeeralakshmi changed her name to Rahima after her conversion. The young mother pins her decision to convert on the dominant caste Thevars in Dombuchery, who violently attacked her husband, Mohammad Ismail, on November 4, 2021, the day of Deepavali.\n\nMohammad Ismail&nbsp;\n\u201cMy husband had taken our aunt to the neighbouring village to meet a doctor. On returning, he saw that a group of 30 men from the Thevar community were attacking his uncle Vairamuthu and four other cousins. When he intervened, he was hit on the head and had to be hospitalised for 10 days,\u201d Rahima says. As per Rahima\u2019s account, the Thevar men had asked her husband and his relatives how they could afford to buy cars and bikes, and then proceeded to vandalise the vehicles.\n\nBike vandalised on November 4\n\u201cThey took two of our cars and four bikes. They also hit six of us, out of which two of us \u2014 me and my uncle Vairamuthu \u2014 were badly injured and had to be hospitalised in the Kanavilakku Government Hospital in Theni,\u201d Mohammad Ismail tells TNM.\n\nOn November 4, four bikes and two cars belonging to the Arundhatiyar community\n\n\tPeriodic atrocities targeting Dalits\nIsmail adds that the above mentioned incident was not an isolated act of violence from the Thevar community. According to him, Thevar men would periodically visit the street where he and other Dalit families lived and target them. These men would start \u2018riots\u2019 and damage the houses and vehicles of the Dalit families, he says. \u201cThese men are jealous that we are able to buy cars and bikes. They ask how we Dalits are dressed so well and able to afford the vehicles?\u201d Ismail says.\nThe seeds of the November 4 violence were sown six months before it happened. According to Ismail, his uncle Palanichamy was attacked by a 22-year-old man, Alex, who belonged to the Thevar community. Alex, Ismail says, struck 38-year-old Palanichamy on the head with a knife. Badly injured, Palanichamy was immediately taken to a hospital in Theni, while Alex fled from the spot.\nAfter a police complaint, Alex was arrested and remanded to 15-days of judicial custody following which he was released. However, the arrest triggered resentment and anger within the Thevar community. Although seemingly calm, communal tensions were simmering in Dombuchery.\nFinally on November 4, Alex\u2019s brother gathered 30 Thevar men and entered the Dalit habitation. Arguments led to a violent clash which led to Ismail and Vairamuthu being badly injured.\n\nIsmail after being attacked on November 4\n\n\tCaste-based discrimination\nTamil Puligal party\u2019s North Theni secretary Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who was earlier known as Vairamuthu, says that ever since he remembers, dominant caste members of Dombuchery practised caste-based discrimination.\n\u201cDalit residents cannot get a hair cut inside the village,\u201d he says. The barber would only attend to Thevar men and the Dalit residents would have to go to neighbourhood villages to get hair cuts, he says. Similarly, if Dalit men visited the village tea shop, they could only sit on the floor and would be served in different tumblers, he explains. Rahima adds that Dalit men and women would be heckled if they walked to the bus stand, which was located close to the Thevar habitation. They would not be allowed to walk on the street or earlier and weren\u2019t allowed to wear slippers, she says.\nVairamuthu explains that the BJP, RSS and the Hindu Munnani party in the district were spinning a false propaganda of forced religious conversion and that the Dalit people were accepting money to convert. However, the reality, he says, is that there was no need to force or offer money. \u201cPeople volunteered to opt out of Hinduism and embrace a religion that would accept them,\u201d he says.\nThe eight families were the first batch, and more members from the 400-strong Dalit community in&nbsp;Dombuchery are expected to embrace Islam, according to him.\n\nMen from Dombuchery offering Namaz in a room&nbsp;\n\u201cThese Hindu organisations did not come to our aid when we were attacked and our homes and belongings were vandalised. But after hearing that we converted, they met us and requested us to reconvert. Why should we?\u201d Mohammad Ismail asks.\nIsmail cites denial of community acceptance and self respect as the major reasons for the eight Dalit families to convert to Islam \u201cWhen we were Hindus, the Thevar men addressed my grandfather and father by their names. They would not even respect my grandfather\u2019s age,\u201d he says. But Ismail insists that Islam has offered him and his community people equality, brotherhood, community acceptance, and most importantly self respect. The older Muslim members of the Theni mosque, which the eight families had visited in December, welcomed them with open arms, and offered them food and company, Ismail says.\nWith no mosque in Dombuchery, the eight families have been doing their namaaz or daily prayers in their houses. However, with more members converting to Islam, they hope to build a small mosque in the future.\nHowever, the families are unsure whether their conversion would help lessen caste-based targeting and attacks from the Thevars. \u201cIt has only been one month since we embraced Islam. We have to wait and watch how this will affect our dynamics with the Thevars,\u201d Ismail adds.\n\n\tLocal leaders stay neutral\nBoth the AIADMK and DMK have significant control over the wards in Dombucheri panchayat. However, the local bodies are mainly run by the intermediary castes such as the Thevars.\nA majority of the elected members including the district panchayat secretary, the union panchayat secretary and the branch secretaries etc., are from the dominant Hindu communities including the Thevars, explains Mohammad Ali Jinnah\n\u201cAnd although these members do not support the dominant caste groups, they still do not interfere during caste-clashes between us and the Thevar men, as they don\u2019t want to upset the latter,\u201d says Jinnah.\nCertain seats in the panchayat are reserved for the SC community, which includes the Arundhatiyar, Paraiyar and Pallar communities. However, these elected members are a minority and cannot take political stances or decisions in isolation. \u201cUsually they have to listen to senior members of their party i.e.,. the local wings of the DMK or the AIADMK, which will consist of UC men,\u201d Jinnah explains.\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Thu, 10 Feb 2022 11:58:33 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 10, 11, 58, 33, 3, 41, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""AjayR""}], ""author"": ""AjayR"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""AjayR""}, ""id"": ""160840 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/caste-oppression-leading-dalit-families-converting-islam-tn-village-160840#comments""}, {""title"": ""TN BJP chief K Annamalai demands NIA probe into petrol bomb attack"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu-feeds"", ""value"": ""TN BJP chief K Annamalai demands NIA probe into petrol bomb attack""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-bjp-chief-k-annamalai-demands-nia-probe-petrol-bomb-attack-160838""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-bjp-chief-k-annamalai-demands-nia-probe-petrol-bomb-attack-160838"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">NEET </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The state BJP chief believes there is a \u2018larger conspiracy\u2019 behind the incident of a petrol bomb being hurled at the party headquarters in Chennai. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/tnm-staff\"">TNM Staff</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/K-Annamalai_PTI_150721_1200x800-3_0.jpg\""><img alt=\""K Annamalai in blue shirt with mask down\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/K-Annamalai_PTI_150721_1200x800-3_0.jpg?itok=EI4w3u9w\"" title=\""K Annamalai in blue shirt with mask down\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Image credit: PTI </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Top leaders of the BJP in Tamil Nadu have demanded an NIA (National Investigation Agency) probe into the petrol bomb incident at Chennai\u2019s BJP headquarters on Thursday, February 10.&nbsp;Addressing the press, state BJP chief K Annamalai said that he wanted all the \u201cfundamentalists and anti-national forces behind this attack to be arrested and brought to justice\u201d.\nThe police were quick to identify one accused&nbsp;involved in the attack carried out at 1:30 am in front of Kamalalayam located in downtown T Nagar on Thursday.

Citing author Orhan Pamuk's differentiation between a 'naive and a sentimental novelist\u2019, the judge had said that Maridhas's post could be classified as 'naive writing'\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Thu, 10 Feb 2022 08:04:13 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 10, 8, 4, 13, 3, 41, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Jahnavi""}], ""author"": ""Jahnavi"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Jahnavi""}, ""id"": ""160828 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/madras-hc-quashes-another-case-against-youtuber-maridhas-160828#comments""}], ""feed"": {""language"": ""en"", ""title"": ""Tamil Nadu"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu-feeds"", ""value"": ""Tamil Nadu""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu-feeds""}, {""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil.xml"", ""rel"": ""self"", ""type"": ""application/rss+xml""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu-feeds"", ""subtitle"": """", ""subtitle_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil-nadu-feeds"", ""value"": """"}}, ""headers"": {""server"": ""nginx"", ""date"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:25:01 GMT"", ""content-type"": ""application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8"", ""transfer-encoding"": ""chunked"", ""connection"": ""close"", ""x-drupal-cache"": ""MISS"", ""vary"": ""Cookie"", ""cache-control"": ""no-cache, must-revalidate"", ""x-content-type-options"": ""nosniff"", ""expires"": ""Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:30:01"", ""content-language"": ""en"", ""x-frame-options"": ""ALLOW FROM SAMEORIGIN, SAMEDOMAIN, https://jionewsdev1.jio.ril.com/, https://jionews.com/"", ""permissions-policy"": ""interest-cohort=()"", ""x-cache-status"": ""MISS""}, ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/tamil.xml"", ""status"": 200, ""encoding"": ""utf-8"", ""version"": ""rss20"", ""namespaces"": {""dc"": ""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"", """": ""http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"", ""og"": ""http://ogp.me/ns#"", ""content"": ""http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"", ""foaf"": ""http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"", ""rdfs"": ""http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"", ""sioc"": ""http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"", ""sioct"": ""http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#"", ""skos"": ""http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#"", ""xsd"": ""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#""}}"

The annual tribal festival, held at the Sri Raja Rajeswara temple in Medaram in Telangana\u2019s Mulugu district, will be held this year from February 16 to 19. The invitations for the religious festival, usually held in February, are ready and are being shipped to guests from across the country. The Tribal Welfare Department of Telangana has prepared the special invitation and guests who receive it will also receive tribal art and craft in a gift box along with the invitation.\nEvery year, for the last three years, the Tribal Welfare Department of Telangana has been coordinating efforts to plan a special invitation every year. This year the special invite is being sent out to Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, and other national and state level dignitaries. The gift box contains an invitation, a coffee table book, Koya and Gond community\u2019s paintings, Naikpod masks, Oja Gond crafts, Banjara crafts and information stickers.\nThe gift box will present to the recipient an overview of the famous Jathara. It will also include a daily programme schedule of the events to be held between February 16 and 19. The coffee table book, titled \u2018The Legend of Medaram\u2019, is the main highlight of the gift box. The book describes briefly the essential features of the life and culture of the tribes of Telangana with attractive representational images. The Koya or Gond paintings in the gift box have been made by young artists from the community and are beautifully framed. Another highlight is the Naikpod mask&nbsp; Potharaju- made by the Naikpod tribals and framed in a transparent box. A brass metal craft- a tortoise- made cleverly by the Oja Gonds is also part of the box. A potli or a pouch, which is a handicraft of the Lambada community is also present in the box. The pouch will have the sacred turmeric powder of the Goddess Sri Sammakka. Information stickers explaining the details and significance of the contents of the special invite are also made available in the box.\n\nVivek Joseph, Hyderabad-based independent researcher and social worker who has researched the religious culture of the Telangana communities, felt the gift box is representative of centuries of confluence and interaction of indigenous peoples and cultures from Telangana and beyond. \u201cWhile it is a commemoration of the adivasi Koyas, for goddesses whom the Koyas consider daughters of the community, the jatara has also long brought in worshippers from other communities, particularly adivasis in the Telugu states and its neighbours. Such dynamics of interaction have only increased with modernisation and shifting of communal boundaries,\u201d he said.\nExplaining the significance of the artefacts and throwing light on the tribal communities Vivek said, \u201cWhile the paintings in the box are from larger adivasi communities such as the Koya and Gond, the other items represent smaller communities of adivasi and nomadic tribal people that have also become tied to Medaram. The Wojaris or Oja Gonds, a nomadic tribal brass founders community, have their ancient craft highlighted and the nomadic Banjara or Lambada their fabrics. One gift also indicates the evolution amongst these communities of their own religious traditions in relation to Samakka and Saralamma.\u201d\nThe mask from Naikpods, an Adivasi community traditionally engaged in shifting cultivation, is of Potaraju, who is considered the brother of local goddesses such as Pochamma and Yellamma widely worshipped by Telugu Dalit-Bahujan communities. \u201cFor the vast numbers of devotees from these communities and the Naikpods who have increasingly participated in the Jatara in recent decades, Samakka and Saralamma are worshipped in much the same way as their local goddesses, with men possessed by Potaraju being a common sight now at Medaram,\u201d added Vivek.\n\nThe box, according to Vivek, is an interesting way of giving recognition to these adivasi and nomadic peoples and their relationship with the jathara. This comes at a time when the heightened influx of non-tribal communities and commercialisation have brought increased ecological destruction to the traditional lands of adivasi people in and around Medaram. Many,&nbsp; particularly the Koya community, fear that this is a cultural appropriation of their beliefs.\n\nMeanwhile, preparations are in full swing to welcome the lakhs of guests arriving, to be a part of the annual festival. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reported to have participated in the annual religious congregation and this year the number is expected to increase because the COVID-19 pandemic situation is better controlled than last year. Speaking to TNM, Mulugu district additional collector Ila Tripathi said, \u201cWe are well prepared. We have been seeing a heavy rush since Sankranti. Every Wednesday, around 2-4 lakh people gather. They have been coming in batches. Special arrangements have been made and staff has been deployed in large numbers to ensure everything goes smoothly.&nbsp; We are focusing on sanitation because of prevailing COVID-19 conditions.\u201d\nPhotos by special arrangement\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/telangana-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Culture</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The popular tribal festival, held at the Sri Raja Rajeswara temple in Telangana\u2019s Mulugu district, is all set to be held this year from February 16 to 19.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/paul-oommen\"">Paul Oommen</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/MedantaInvite_TRS_12022022_1135_byarrangement_1200.jpg\""><img alt=\""A box with an invitation to Medaram Jatharam, a tribal festival in Telangana\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/MedantaInvite_TRS_12022022_1135_byarrangement_1200.jpg?itok=jfuEtQEE\"" title=\""An invite for Medaram Jatharam\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Photo by special arrangement</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The Medaram Jatharam, popularly known as Sammaka Saralamma Jathara, is one of the largest tribal religious congregations in India.

His was among the five deaths that have rocked the village in the last four months. All the five men who died, four of whom were Dalit, were&nbsp;said to be addicted to alcohol.\nWith a population of less than 3,000&nbsp;and not connected by public transport, Marepalli has been embroiled in a controversy over the sale of liquor at belt shops \u2013 extended counters operated illegally by existing liquor stores.&nbsp;Common across villages in the state, these belt shops are allegedly run by paying commissions to permitted wine shops and bribing local police and Prohibition and Excise Department officials.\nA day after Naveen\u2019s death, Dalit women and youth headed to the six belt shops in the village, alleging that liquor addiction was behind the death by suicide and the three other deaths in their colony. The women reportedly asked the shop owners to stop the sale of liquor. An exchange of words allegedly prompted some of the women to ransack the liquor bottles in all the stores.\nHowever, while the police filed a case against the Dalits for alleged rioting and looting&nbsp;and sent them to judicial custody, no action was taken against the men running the illegal liquor shops.\n\n\tArrested under false charges\nTwo days after the incident, Kondapur police booked 19 people under sections 147 (Punishment for rioting), 148 (Rioting with deadly weapons), 327 (Voluntarily causing hurt to extort property), 386 (Extortion by putting a person in fear&nbsp;of death or grievous hurt) and 444 (Lurking house-trespass by night) read with 144 (Unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. The charge against the Dalits was that they had attacked Purra Mahesh Goud, who runs one of the belt shops in the village, and snatched Rs 30,000 from his shop.\nOn January 24, the police summoned all those who were booked to the police station in the name of counselling and allegedly forced them to sign some papers.&nbsp;According to the Dalits, the Sub Inspector (SI) at the Kondapur police station threatened to file a case under the Preventive Detention Act (PD Act) and open a rowdy sheet if they didn\u2019t sign the&nbsp;papers. Thirteen people, including four women, were detained at the Sangareddy district jail for 10 days.\n\nActivists felicitating the Dalit men and women who were arrested and later released from jail\nBut despite repeated oral complaints and one written complaint given by the Dalit residents on January 18, the police did not register any case against Purra Ashok Goud, Goundla Chennam Goud, Nimmamgari Laxmaiah, Kambalapalli Raju, Govindapuram Maneyya and Purra Raju, the men running the belt stores in the village.\n\n\t\u2018Families are being ruined\u2019\nWhen this reporter visited the colony on February 4, a day after the arrested people were released, Dalit activists and organisations had arrived to express their solidarity with the local residents. Around 150 Dalits gathered near the Dr BR Ambedkar statue in the village and took a pledge: \u201cWe\u2019re pledging to start a movement to ban belt shops from Marepalli. Jai Bhim!\u201d\n\n\t\n\tA meeting held after garlanding Dr BR Ambedkar\nThe jailed residents said that the men from the colony were becoming addicted to alcohol, spending all their earnings through daily wage labour on drinks or completely abandoning their work.\n\u201cMy son used to be inebriated throughout the day, he came home only to beat up his wife seeking money,\u201d said Sushila, Naveen\u2019s mother. Naveen was the sole breadwinner of his family of five, which included his parents, wife and two young children.\n\n\tSushila, Naveen's mother at Dalit colony\nAnother reason for people continuing to be alcoholic, the residents said, is that the belt shops give liquor on credit if the customers don\u2019t have money.\nNaveen used to work as a daily wage worker until some months ago, but ever since he started working at a belt shop he became an alcoholic, according to his mother. \u201cThey never paid him, instead they gave him liquor on a daily basis. That day he shouted at us and fought with us seeking money before taking his own life,\u201d she said.\nAccording to Kondapuram Prashanth, one of the accused in the case, several men from the colony were addicted to alcohol, which in turn impacted their families as well. He said, \u201cFamilies are being ruined. We have been urging the police and excise officials to take action and shut down the belt shops but they didn\u2019t listen to us.\u201d\nAnother man, Meesala Narasimlu, 48, died&nbsp;near the premises of a belt shop last October allegedly after consuming liquor. Locals who did not want to&nbsp;reveal their identity told TNM that Narasimlu\u2019s body was moved from where he died fearing an attack on the shop by the villagers.\nWhile the villagers believe that it is excessive consumption of alcohol that is taking a toll, Dalit activists alleged that adulterated liquor sold at the belt shops is causing the deaths. Mupparapu Prakash, president of Samajika Hakkula Sangam (Sahasam),&nbsp;said, \u201cPeople are consuming liquor from belt shops in other places as well, but only men who consumed liquor from these shops have lost their lives. The cheap liquor sold here is adulterated with chemicals used in toddy-making.\u201d\nPrakash added, \u201cProhibition and Excise Department officials were also negligent. When the villagers complained about the illegal liquor stores, they neither visited the village nor took any action on the people who ran the shops.\u201d\n\nMeesala Sushila, Meesala Bhagyamma and Meesala Ananda: Family members of the men who died due to liquor addiction\n\n\tOne-sided action by the police?\nA complaint purportedly lodged by the Dalit women and villagers against the illegal liquor shops was not taken into consideration for initiating any criminal action. On the other hand, the police were quick to book the Dalits who ransacked liquor bottles at the shops.\nS Mariyamma, a woman accused in the \u201cattack\u201d on the shop owners, said, \u201cWe went there to caution them to stop selling liquor illegally in the village as it is ruining the families and the health of the people. But the shop owners spoke to us in a provocative manner and said that we are no one to tell them as they are paying commission to police and excise officials. They abused us with our caste names.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cWe didn\u2019t attack anyone physically, we threw out liquor bottles, but they filed a case against us saying we looted money from the counter. That is not true.\u201d\nThis reporter approached two of the shops where illegal liquor was sold earlier. While there was no one available at one shop, the person in the other place refused to comment.\nHowever, the police officer overseeing the investigation into the case denied the allegations made by the accused. Speaking to TNM, Kondapur SI Srinivas Reddy said, \u201cWe registered a case based on the prima facie evidence. The initial investigation found 13 people indulged in rioting and theft.\u201d\nWhen asked about the inaction on the belt shops, the officer said that all the six shop owners were booked for selling liquor without license in violation of the Prohibition and Excise Act and were presented before the Kondapur Tehsildar (who is the Executive Magistrate). However, he did not mention the specific sections under which they were charged.\n\n\t\n\tA kirana store at which liquor was being sold illegally\nThe SI also denied threatening to slap the PD Act and rowdy sheet on the accused. He said, \u201cAt the time of the investigation also they were saying that they will attack the complainants for lodging the complaint. We did not threaten them but cautioned them about the consequences of taking the law into their hands.\u201d\nThe SI also said that the deaths cannot be linked to the consumption of liquor. \u201cWhile one was death by suicide, our investigation revealed that the other four deaths too can\u2019t be attributed to consumption of alcohol from these belt shops.\u201d\nSangareddy Prohibition and Excise (P&amp;E) Superintendent D Gayatri also said that her office was unaware of the existence of the six belt shops until the vandalism took place. When asked about the alleged negligent approach when the villagers brought the belt shops issue to their notice, the Superintendent said, \u201cThe villagers gave a representation about the belt shops on January 19. We have taken action on the same. Now there are no belt shops in the village or sale of liquor in any manner.\u201d\nWhen asked about the alleged adulteration of liquor causing the deaths, the officer said, \u201cThere was no complaint lodged when the deaths occurred. We could have investigated scientifically and taken action accordingly.\u201d\nHowever, she did not have an answer when asked why her officials did not know about the existence of the six belt shops in a village that does not even have public transport facility.\n\n\tPolitical pressure?\nAccording to Errolla Prashanth, another jailed resident, the belt shop owners initially did not want to lodge a police complaint about the vandalism following Naveen\u2019s death. He said, \u201cThey were quiet for two days, as it happened spontaneously following the death by suicide. But two days later, their syndicate \u2013 which does not want our village to be liquor-free \u2013 saw a threat to their business and prompted two of the shop owners to give a complaint and file false charges of theft of money and gold chain.\u201d\nAccording to a resident, the case was filed just to \u201cteach a lesson\u201d to the Dalits. \u201cThose liquor shops were a point of controversy for the last three to four months. Everyone in the village wanted them to be shut down but those who run them are influential in the village and have political support,\u201d he alleged.\nA journalist from a popular Telugu news channel who covers the erstwhile Medak district also confirmed the same to TNM: \u201cEven licensed wine shops cultivate small belt shops in order to do more sales. The syndicate saw a threat to their business, and when the women ransacked the shops they filed a complaint.\u201d\nOf the six belt shops, five were run by Gouds and one by Yadav, both Backward Class (BC) communities. Residents alleged that these liquor shop owners approached TRS leaders who pressurised the police to act quickly on the Dalits.\nNow Dalits in the village are demanding the arrest of the belt shop owners under murder charges, for selling illegal liquor and causing deaths. Prabavathi S, one of the accused women who was released from jail, told TNM, \u201cWe were sent to jail for doing what the police and excise officials are supposed to do, but there is no action on the belt shop owners who are the reason behind the deaths of the five men in the village.\u201d\nREAD:&nbsp;How Nalgonda cops cracked down on a 460 kg ganja haul with TRS link\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/telangana-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Ground Report </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">In the last four months, Marepalli witnessed the deaths of four Dalit men.

When the villagers complained about the illegal liquor stores, they neither visited the village nor took any action on the people who ran the shops.\u201d\n\nMeesala Sushila, Meesala Bhagyamma and Meesala Ananda: Family members of the men who died due to liquor addiction\n\n\tOne-sided action by the police?\nA complaint purportedly lodged by the Dalit women and villagers against the illegal liquor shops was not taken into consideration for initiating any criminal action. On the other hand, the police were quick to book the Dalits who ransacked liquor bottles at the shops.\nS Mariyamma, a woman accused in the \u201cattack\u201d on the shop owners, said, \u201cWe went there to caution them to stop selling liquor illegally in the village as it is ruining the families and the health of the people. But the shop owners spoke to us in a provocative manner and said that we are no one to tell them as they are paying commission to police and excise officials. They abused us with our caste names.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cWe didn\u2019t attack anyone physically, we threw out liquor bottles, but they filed a case against us saying we looted money from the counter. That is not true.\u201d\nThis reporter approached two of the shops where illegal liquor was sold earlier. While there was no one available at one shop, the person in the other place refused to comment.\nHowever, the police officer overseeing the investigation into the case denied the allegations made by the accused. Speaking to TNM, Kondapur SI Srinivas Reddy said, \u201cWe registered a case based on the prima facie evidence. The initial investigation found 13 people indulged in rioting and theft.\u201d\nWhen asked about the inaction on the belt shops, the officer said that all the six shop owners were booked for selling liquor without license in violation of the Prohibition and Excise Act and were presented before the Kondapur Tehsildar (who is the Executive Magistrate). However, he did not mention the specific sections under which they were charged.\n\n\t\n\tA kirana store at which liquor was being sold illegally\nThe SI also denied threatening to slap the PD Act and rowdy sheet on the accused. He said, \u201cAt the time of the investigation also they were saying that they will attack the complainants for lodging the complaint. We did not threaten them but cautioned them about the consequences of taking the law into their hands.\u201d\nThe SI also said that the deaths cannot be linked to the consumption of liquor. \u201cWhile one was death by suicide, our investigation revealed that the other four deaths too can\u2019t be attributed to consumption of alcohol from these belt shops.\u201d\nSangareddy Prohibition and Excise (P&amp;E) Superintendent D Gayatri also said that her office was unaware of the existence of the six belt shops until the vandalism took place. When asked about the alleged negligent approach when the villagers brought the belt shops issue to their notice, the Superintendent said, \u201cThe villagers gave a representation about the belt shops on January 19. We have taken action on the same. Now there are no belt shops in the village or sale of liquor in any manner.\u201d\nWhen asked about the alleged adulteration of liquor causing the deaths, the officer said, \u201cThere was no complaint lodged when the deaths occurred. We could have investigated scientifically and taken action accordingly.\u201d\nHowever, she did not have an answer when asked why her officials did not know about the existence of the six belt shops in a village that does not even have public transport facility.\n\n\tPolitical pressure?\nAccording to Errolla Prashanth, another jailed resident, the belt shop owners initially did not want to lodge a police complaint about the vandalism following Naveen\u2019s death. He said, \u201cThey were quiet for two days, as it happened spontaneously following the death by suicide. But two days later, their syndicate \u2013 which does not want our village to be liquor-free \u2013 saw a threat to their business and prompted two of the shop owners to give a complaint and file false charges of theft of money and gold chain.\u201d\nAccording to a resident, the case was filed just to \u201cteach a lesson\u201d to the Dalits. \u201cThose liquor shops were a point of controversy for the last three to four months. Everyone in the village wanted them to be shut down but those who run them are influential in the village and have political support,\u201d he alleged.\nA journalist from a popular Telugu news channel who covers the erstwhile Medak district also confirmed the same to TNM: \u201cEven licensed wine shops cultivate small belt shops in order to do more sales. The syndicate saw a threat to their business, and when the women ransacked the shops they filed a complaint.\u201d\nOf the six belt shops, five were run by Gouds and one by Yadav, both Backward Class (BC) communities. Residents alleged that these liquor shop owners approached TRS leaders who pressurised the police to act quickly on the Dalits.\nNow Dalits in the village are demanding the arrest of the belt shop owners under murder charges, for selling illegal liquor and causing deaths. Prabavathi S, one of the accused women who was released from jail, told TNM, \u201cWe were sent to jail for doing what the police and excise officials are supposed to do, but there is no action on the belt shop owners who are the reason behind the deaths of the five men in the village.\u201d\nREAD:&nbsp;How Nalgonda cops cracked down on a 460 kg ganja haul with TRS link\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Fri, 11 Feb 2022 10:36:55 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 11, 10, 36, 55, 4, 42, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Paul Oommen""}], ""author"": ""Paul Oommen"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Paul Oommen""}, ""id"": ""160872 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tiny-telangana-village-and-dalit-residents-fight-shut-down-illegal-liquor-shops-160872#comments""}, {""title"": ""Hyderabad's Numaish likely to reopen as COVID-19 cases decline"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/telangana-feeds"", ""value"": ""Hyderabad's Numaish likely to reopen as COVID-19 cases decline""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyderabads-numaish-likely-reopen-covid-19-cases-decline-160858""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/hyderabads-numaish-likely-reopen-covid-19-cases-decline-160858"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Numaish</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">All India Industrial Exhibition Society, the organisers of the annual event, are planning to resume &#039;Numaish&#039; from February 20-25.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/ians\"">IANS</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/Numaish_hyderabad_exhibition_12112020.jpg\""><img alt=\""File photo of the Numaish in Hyderabad\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/Numaish_hyderabad_exhibition_12112020.jpg?itok=y-dTmylo\"" title=\""File photo of the Numaish in Hyderabad\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Image for representation</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Hyderabad's popular annual trade fair 'Numaish', which was abruptly shut down a day after inauguration on January 6 due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, is likely to be reopened later this month.

Out of 9 people involved, 7 were arrested and 2 are presently absconding. A Sarpanch, affiliated to the ruling-TRS party, from Narayankhed town in Telangana\u2019s Sangareddy district was among those who have been arrested.

The Sarpanch, a man with contacts of people who have taken ganja consignments to Maharashtra in the past, offered to arrange a team and make other arrangements for the operation. The Sarpanch roped in Rahul Gadse from Solapur district of Maharashtra. Rahul, who runs a flower business accompanied by Akshay Sanjay Babber, agreed to be a part of the operation.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\nThe seized cell phones and the money recovered from the possession of the accused\nHow the cops cracked down\nHyderabad-based Venkatanarayana got in touch with Odisha-based Satyababu who hails from Malkangiri. A driver was arranged to collect the ganja consignment from Satyababu at Bhadrachalam in Bhadradri Kothagudem district in Telangana. The consignment was loaded into an Innova car and was then brought to Nalgonda.\nThe ganja was packed neatly into 2-kg packets and there were a total of 230 packages. The packages were loaded into the car and covered using a bedsheet. Speaking to TNM, Nalgonda SP, Rema Rajeswari said, \u201cUsually the consignments that are caught are well covered and difficult to easily identify. However, in this particular case the car\u2019s seat was folded and the packages were neatly arranged. They thought that by leaving it like passenger luggage they could get away without being noticed.\u201d\nIn Nalgonda district\u2019s Chityal, the two teams-the supply team and the collection team, met at a dhaba where the transaction was meant to take place. Police swooped in on them and took seven of them into custody. Satyababu the man from Odisha who supplied the consignment managed to escape. A team has been presently deployed to nab him.\n\u201cAltogether around 25 police personnel were part of the crackdown operation. There were members from the task force, personnel from the local police station, inspectors and the technical team who were involved. We monitored them for nearly 24 hours, before cracking down on them. They had planned to collect the consignment and then travel to Hyderabad and then further to Warangal. From Warangal they had planned to take it to Maharashtra. They were expecting to sell the ganja at Rs 10,000 per kg,\u201d added SP Rajeswari.&nbsp;\nAccording to the police, the usual modus operandi is to bring the ganja consignments to Hyderabad and then load it into buses and then take it to Maharashtra. However, due to the heightened checking, it was decided to load it into buses from Warangal.

He said the country was being run as per the Constitution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that Modi had taken control of all institutions including Governors and the Election Commission. He pointed out how relations between the Governor and the Chief Minister in West Bengal were strained.\nKTR reiterated the demand that Modi apologise to the people of Telangana for insulting the Telangana movement through his remarks in Parliament on Tuesday.

He instructed the officials to complete promotions and transfers and implement the reforms by June 2022.&nbsp;\n</div></div></div>""}, ""published"": ""Thu, 10 Feb 2022 09:47:53 +0000"", ""published_parsed"": [2022, 2, 10, 9, 47, 53, 3, 41, 0], ""authors"": [{""name"": ""Jahnavi""}], ""author"": ""Jahnavi"", ""author_detail"": {""name"": ""Jahnavi""}, ""id"": ""160836 at https://www.thenewsminute.com"", ""guidislink"": false, ""comments"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/andhra-class-10-intermediate-exam-schedule-released-details-here-160836#comments""}, {""title"": ""'It's as if our dreams don't matter': Students barred for wearing hijab speak"", ""title_detail"": {""type"": ""text/plain"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/education-feeds"", ""value"": ""'It's as if our dreams don't matter': Students barred for wearing hijab speak""}, ""links"": [{""rel"": ""alternate"", ""type"": ""text/html"", ""href"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/its-if-our-dreams-dont-matter-students-barred-wearing-hijab-speak-160644""}], ""link"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/its-if-our-dreams-dont-matter-students-barred-wearing-hijab-speak-160644"", ""summary"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Education</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">The students have urged the college management to stop reducing their identity to the hijab and allow them back on campus.</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/prajwal-bhat\"">Prajwal Bhat</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/HijabProtest_050221_1200.jpg\""><img alt=\""Girls in hijab sitting outside college gates in Kundapura\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/HijabProtest_050221_1200.jpg?itok=kYLhoeg8\"" title=\""Girls in hijab sitting outside college gates in Kundapura\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">\""I am studying in the biology stream and I have practical exams from the end of March and board exams in mid-April.

In a response to Trinamool Congress MP Derek O\u2019 Brien\u2019s question, the Ministry of Women and Child Development said that of the total expenditure of Rs 683.05 crore toward the scheme between 2014-15 and 2020-21, Rs 401.04 crore \u2014 or 58% \u2014 went towards media campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nBeti Bachao Beti Padhao is a flagship scheme of the Narendra Modi government which was launched in 2015 to address declining child sex ratio and focuses on issues such as sex-selective termination and protection of the girl child. The answer claimed that key elements of the scheme include nationwide media and advocacy campaigns. \u201cAs per the scheme guidelines, fund is earmarked for districts identified for multi-sectoral interventions, for extending community outreach, advocacy and generating awareness, inter alia, through various means, including media,\u201d it said.\nIt added that in the initial phase, the emphasis has been on media for awareness generation and to bring about a shift in attitude. \u201cThe all India advertisements of BBBP have been able to successfully establish the brand BBBP which has an excellent recall value.

The court gave the directions while hearing petitions relating to the COVID-19 situation in the state.\nDespite the COVID-19 threat persisting, the state government announced reopening of the educational institutions from February 1, after extended Sankranti vacation for 23 days.\nAll schools, colleges and universities reopened but the attendance remained poor as the state continues to report a large number of COVID-19 cases. With many students and even teachers down with the COVID-19 symptoms, a majority of the private schools and colleges have not resumed physical classes.\nEven in the government-run institutions, the attendance percentage remained around 42%.

Many parents are still reluctant to send their children to schools due to the persisting COVID-19 threat.

Similarly, it issued directions for enforcing COVID-19 curbs during 'Samatha Murthy Sahasrabdhi' celebrations on the outskirts of Hyderabad.\nThe government was told to make sure that there is no spike in COVID-19 cases once again due to negligence.

But that was in 2020, and the pandemic hit just as the school year was about to begin. After over a year and a half of attending online sessions, he finally got the opportunity to go to preschool physically and be among his peers in September last year. However, that only lasted a month before the third wave of COVID-19 forced people back into their homes and classes back online.&nbsp;\nSeveral studies show that the first five years of an individual\u2019s life are instrumental in the way they develop \u2014 emotionally, cognitively, physically and behaviourally. When a child joins preschool, typically at the age of three or four, they are exposed to a host of new experiences which can shape them. \u201cPreschools give children the opportunity to be in a space that allows them peer interaction. When you are in a preschool, you are in an environment that naturally allows practices to develop, to be around peers, and learning to communicate with them,\u201d says Lakshmi Rammohan, co-founder of the Earthlings Early Years preschool in Bengaluru.&nbsp;\nWhile learning loss in online education has been noticed in children across age groups, many argue that it is preschoolers, between the ages of 3 and 5, who are affected the most. This is because preschools play an important role in facilitating the child\u2019s overall development. As the third year of the pandemic has rolled in, Raghav\u2019s story is similar to several young children who have been forced to spend their most active and developmentally-rich years indoors, in front of a screen.\n\n\tLearning loss in the pandemic\nOnce a child is in class 1, they are expected to follow a particular syllabus, learn things by rote, be able to read and write for long stretches, etc. But preschool is meant to lay the foundation for the child to learn these skills. Most preschools focus on learning through activities and play. Through this, a child can learn abstract skills \u2014 focusing, compromising, trust, following instructions and more \u2014 in a natural way.\nIn preschools, without the expectation of academic learning, children develop the building blocks of problem-solving tools that they will use throughout their lives. This is, in large part, because it is the first time that children are in an environment other than the home, where there is no caregiver to anticipate the child\u2019s needs.\nRaghav\u2019s mother Vaishnavi says that the preschool they chose does not put much pressure on the child or parent, even when conducted online. However, due to the pandemic, many children of Raghav\u2019s age are compelled to sit in front of screens and thus have a two-dimensional idea of learning. \u201cIt must be very hard to socialise for a small child who has never been to school or interacted with other children, and has only interacted with his classmates online. They would usually take cues from body language and expressions, which is difficult when one is wearing a mask or interacting online,\u201d she says.\nChild psychologist Nisha John says that preschool also helps children to concentrate on one particular task and follow it through to the end. She gives the example of learning numbers through an abacus. \u201cThis is focused attention on a single task, and sustained attention for a long period. At home, the child may give up halfway and want to do something else. But in preschool, they are not allowed to leave a task midway. They miss out on learning these basic skills by not going to school,\u201d she says.\nAnother important aspect, she mentions, is that a preschool can expose a child to environments and situations other than what they are used to. And since children under the age of five experience many things for the first time \u2014 climbing up and down stairs, walking in a line, holding a crayon \u2014 they are free to explore and learn more at a preschool.\nAccording to Lakshmi, another thing that children miss out on through online preschool is a sense of routine. In a physical preschool, activities happen in a particular time and sequence. \u201cThere is a sense of familiarity \u2014 children take great comfort in familiarity, and they are able to emotionally regulate themselves far better in response to it,\u201d Lakshmi says. This is because routines can make the transition between activities easier. However, the structure becomes more loose at home, as parents may not always be able to pay full attention to their child.&nbsp;\nShe also says that in preschool, activities such as stacking blocks, shape, and colour recognition etc., are developed in a systematic way. But at home, children often play games as they wish. \u201cBy being in a home environment, children can lose out on that systematic approach to organic learning as there is no comprehensiveness \u2014 which is not the parents\u2019 fault,\u201d Lakshmi explains.\nApart from communication and socio-emotional learning, the pandemic has affected the physical activity of children. \u201cHopping, skipping, running, rolling around \u2014 all this happens organically in a school environment. The children also learn to fight and make up with each other, how to take turns, and use their imagination to pretend play. These are all very important for their development, for them to be able to problem solve later on in life,\u201d says Lakshmi.\n\n\tLong-term effects\nAfter two years of living with the pandemic, educators and parents have tried to strike a balance in the way children learn and do their best with the resources that they have. But the sustained sense of uncertainty about the pandemic and the fate of physical classes can have long-term effects on young children, experts believe.\n\u201cThe first five years of a child\u2019s life has spurts of brain development. If there is no stimulation in particular areas (for example motor skills, sensory play, pretend play), the gap between the chronological age and the level of development will keep increasing,\u201d Nisha says.\nBut she adds that children may still be able to learn these skills, albeit a little delayed. Many times, when children exhibit behaviour like tantrums or shortened attention, it may simply mean a lack of stimulation. \u201cIt may not mean the child has an issue. That\u2019s where we come in to see whether it might just be the environment. Children are very resilient by nature,\u201d she says.\nAccording to Lakshmi, since children have been only around their parents or close family for the past two years, their ideas of communication and behaviour come from the adults. Whereas in a preschool, they deal with more diverse social experiences. \u201cThe child is going to grow up till a certain age expecting rational, logical behaviour (of their parents) from everybody, and that is an impractical expectation. We are going to have a set of frustrated children who don\u2019t know how to handle peer equations,\u201d she explains.&nbsp;\n</div></div></div>"", ""summary_detail"": {""type"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""base"": ""https://www.thenewsminute.com/education-feeds"", ""value"": ""<div class=\""field field-name-field-bread-crumb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Education</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Several young children have been forced to spend their most active and developmentally-rich years in front of a screen due to the pandemic. </div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-author-news field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/author-names/aditi-kumar\"">Aditi Kumar</a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-news field-type-image field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\""><a href=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/younggirl_studying_virtualclass_Picxy.comtulshinaik_27012022_1200%20%281%29.jpg\""><img alt=\""A girl writing notes from a laptop screen in front of her\"" height=\""1000\"" src=\""https://www.thenewsminute.com/sites/default/files/styles/slideshow_image_size/public/younggirl_studying_virtualclass_Picxy.comtulshinaik_27012022_1200%20%281%29.jpg?itok=iS4ogK3b\"" title=\""A girl writing notes from a laptop screen in front of her\"" width=\""1200\"" /></a></div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-field-image-blurb-news field-type-text field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">For representation | Pixcy: TulshiNaik</div></div></div><div class=\""field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\""><div class=\""field-items\""><div class=\""field-item even\"">Raghav* was three years old and ready for the next big milestone in his life \u2014 going to preschool.
